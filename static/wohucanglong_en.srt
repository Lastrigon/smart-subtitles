Please come in.

How's business?

11
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,578
Not bad.
And how are you?

12
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,205
Fine.

13
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:09,045
Monk Zheng came by
from the Wudang Mountain.

14
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,756
He said you
were practising
deep meditation.

15
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,718
The mountain must be
so peaceful.

00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,595
l envy you.

17
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,848
My work keeps me so busy
l hardly get a minute's rest.

18
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,268
l broke it off.

19
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,062
l couldn't complete
the training.

20
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:30,733
Why?
You're a Wudang fighter.
Training is everything.

21
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:37,573
During my meditation training,
l came to a place of deep
silence.

22
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,743
l was surrounded by light.

23
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,413
Time and space disappeared.

24
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:49,877
l felt l had come to a place
my master had never told me
about.

25
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,840
You were enlightened.

26
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,508
Far from it.

27
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,470
l didn't feel the bliss
one should feel when
enlightened.

28
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:03,933
lnstead,
l was surrounded
by an endless sorrow.

29
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:08,104
lt was more
than l could take.

30
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:12,024
l couldn't go on.
l failed.

31
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,821
There was something
pulling me back
into the world.

32

What was it?

33
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,329
Something l can't
seem to let go of.

34
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,544
l see you're
preparing to leave.

35
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:36,090
We're making
a delivery to Beijing.

36
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,803
Perhaps
l could ask you to deliver
something to Sir Te for me.

37
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,270

You're giving it to Sir Te?

our greatest protector.

with it?

you a long time.

washes easily from its
blade.

You use it
for good cause,
making you worthy of it.

45
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,009
lt's time for me
to leave it behind.

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,601
Come with me to Beijing.

This is

lt's heavy for such
a thin piece of metal.

111
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:13,052
lt's the handle that's heavy.
And that blade is no
ordinary metal.

Still, the sword is the
lightest of all weapons.

because you're not
used to handling them.

No, l've had a lot
of experience with

Li and l went through
a lot together.

for each other
grew stronger.

you talk about,
l too desire it,

infiltrated the Yus.

have come with them

and catch her there.

always suspected

330

She has the nerve
to come to Beijing.

Official business is already
difficult to resolve,

336
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:41,357

hiding at Yu's.

cross-examined him yet?

Bo? No, not yet. . .

348
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,097
But you've had your men
stake out Yu's compound?

349
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,267
No, l'd already
sent them back.

350
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,438
You can blame me
for losing the sword

351
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:24,025

l'll get it back soon
using my own methods.

Didn't you come back
here for it?

stolen until l got here.

underestimated us women.

Police lnspector from Shaan.

00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:17,771
Homicide must be
reported to Chief Yu.

418
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,607
ln addition,
the victim is an officer.

419

You believe

out in this compound?

This needs to be

l'll get into the Yu

424
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,424
l'll ferret
out this Fox and
her gang in no time.

425
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:50,137
Too dangerous.
Yu is a court official
and in charge of security.

426
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,057
This could ruin his
reputation and career.

427

lt might also get
Sir Te in trouble.

428
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:59,438
This calls for
the utmost delicacy.

429
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:05,110
Sir Te, can you find some
excuse to invite Mrs and
Miss Yu over?

430
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,489
What do you have in mind?

431
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:13,077
The best way to trap a fox
is through her cubs.

432
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:21,585
Oh, my!
Mrs Te is spoiling us
with all these gifts.

433
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,922
She is being
so considerate
to our daughter.

434
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:28,342
l'm sorry she's not
feeling well enough
to entertain you today.

00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,136
l heard Sir Te
has lost something.

436
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,223
And now Mrs Te
is not feeling well.

437
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:37,351
We know who stole
the missing item.

438
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,524
lf the thief returns it

439
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:47,194
l'm sure Sir Te will pursue
the matter no further.

440
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,904
That's good.

441
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:53,367
lt's a real annoyance
to have servants who
steal.

442
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:57,788
Sir Te knows that even
well-meaning people
sometimes make mistakes.

443
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:02,584
Some mistakes can ruin not
only themselves but their
entire family as well.

444
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,712
But don't be too lenient.

445
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:11,301
Sure. For example, no mercy
will be shown to the murderer
who just turned up in Beijing.

446
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,053
MADAME YU: A murderer?

447
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:18,559
Yes, the very killer of
Li Mu Bai's own master.

448
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:22,855
Last night she
killed a policeman who had
tracked her for many years.

449
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,566
MADAME YU:
A female criminal !
Now that's news!

450
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,902
You say she killed
a policeman?

451
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:30,821
Yes, from the west.

452
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:34,575
He went undercover
as a street performer,
and followed her here.

453
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:38,996
l'm no detective, but maybe
the murderer and thief are
the same.

454
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,831
l doubt that.

455
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:45,419
This particular thief
is very unusual.

456
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,589

than a mere killer.

this life,

1028
01:52:04,093 --> 01:52:05,927
be true to yourself.

1029
01:52:53,684 --> 01:52:54,851
Jen !

1030
01:53:39,396 --> 01:53:40,855
(CHATTERlNG)

1031
01:53:55,704 --> 01:53:56,787
Jen.

1032
01:54:00,459 --> 01:54:03,127
Remember the story
you told me in the desert?

1033
01:54:05,422 --> 01:54:08,424
Have faith, then the
dreams will come true.

1034
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:16,390
Make a wish, Lo.

1035
01:54:18,936 --> 01:54:22,438
l wish that we'll
be in the desert,
together again.
