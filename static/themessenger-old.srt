1
00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.523
Is anybody there?

2
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:42.668
Jeanne.

3
00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.237
I’m always happytoseeyou, but to
keep coming twice, three times a day—

4
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.370
- I need to confess.
-You already confessed this morning.

5
00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:55.243
I need to confess again.

6
00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:58.716
What terrible sin
haveyou committed since then...

7
00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:01.447
that can’t wait till tomorrow
to be forgiven?

8
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:05.457
I saw a poor monk without shoes,
so I gave him some.

9
00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:08.494
There’s no sin ¡n chanty,Jeanne.

10
00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:11.052
- They weren’t my shoes.
- Whose were they?

11
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:14.396
- My father’s.
- I’m sure he’ll forgive you.

12
00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.594
He already did.

13
00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.603
But I wantJesus
to forgive me tcx.

14
00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:22.198
If we were to ask forgiveness
all the time...

15
00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:24.209
we’d spend our whole life
¡n church.

16
00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:27.678
- Is that bad?
-Well, no, but—

17
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.378
-Areyou happy at home?
- Oh, yes, very.

18
00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.751
And your mother?
Everything’s fine with her?

19
00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:38.290
Yes, she’s wonderñil.

20
00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:41.418
And your sister, Cathen ne,
she’s still your best friend?

21
00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:45.453
My sisters just—
She’s wonderftil.

22
00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:49.434
And what atxut your other friends?
You don’t like playing with them?

23
00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:52.437
Oh, yes.
I play with them, lots.

24
00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:56.407
Everything sounds wonderftil.

25
00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:59.206
Yes, it is.

26
00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.974
Then why are you here so often?

27
00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:05.983
I feel safe here.
It’s where I can talk to him.

28
00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:09.547
Him?

29
00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:13.356
Well, I tryto talkto him...

30
00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:17.157
but mostly he’s the one
who does the talking.

31
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.996
Who ¡s this The’?

32
00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:25.635
He neyer says his name.

33
00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:29.505
What does he...

34
00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:31.476
look like?

35
00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:39.774
Beautiful.

36
00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:45.253
And what does he say to you?

37
00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.986
He says—

38
00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:56.401
He says—
He says I must be gcxxi..

39
00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:00.496
and help everyone
and take care of myself.

40
00:04:01.874 --> 00:04:03.808
Do you think he’s coming
from the sky?

41
00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:07.704
Perhaps.

42
00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:13.448
But wherever he’s coming from,
I think you should listen to him...

43
00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.182
cause ¡t sounds like
he’s giving you very gcxxi advice.

44
00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:45.142
It’s—
It’s wonderñil!

45
00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:48.076
It’s wonderfiji.

46
00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:07.228
Jeanne.

We’ve all been lcxking for you.
The English are everywhere.

52
00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:43.375
- I was ¡n the church.
- Really?

53
00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:45.842
I was talking to the priest
Do you know what he said to me?

54
00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:47.845
Bum over there!

55
00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:50.381
Tell me later.
Quick, hide ¡n here.

56
00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:54.619
- Where are you gonna be?
- I’ll be right here.

57
00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:56.279
I promise.

58
00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:05.461
Well, that’s what I call Lxxty.

59
00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:44.625
Comrade.

60
00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:01.916
Awoman with a sword.

If that’s Gcxfs will,
then so be it.

64
00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:17.499
Fine with me.
I love women.

65
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.518
Hold still, bitch.

66
00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.859
How can Ido it
¡fyou keep wnggling atxut?

67
00:13:36.615 --> 00:13:37.946
Your turn now.

68
00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:13.813
Gcxi, preserve and bless the soul
of this, our dearly departed.

69
00:14:13.886 --> 00:14:17.322
Keep us safe from fear and sin.
Amen.

70
00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:25.223
Come on.

71
00:15:05.104 --> 00:15:06.503
Listen, J eanne.

72
00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:11.271
Your aunt and uncle are gonna take you
to their house for a couple of weeks...

73
00:15:11.343 --> 00:15:14.312
<No OCR content on this page>

74
00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:24.046
You understand?

75
00:16:33.592 --> 00:16:36.254
Lord, we give thanks
for the fcxxi youve given us.

76
00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:38.262
Teach us always
to love this land...

77
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.231
and to save ¡t from those
who seek to destroy ¡t.

78
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.892
-Amen.
-Amen.

79
00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:08.088
So, goxi night, then.

80
00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:19.468
- What’s going to happen to her?
-She’ll be fine.

81
00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:23.975
She’ll grow up, find a gcxx man,
make him some children. Don’t worry.

82
00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:25.772
She’s been hurt, but she’ll survive.

83
00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:28.836
Tomorrow she’ll be
as right as rain.

84
00:17:28.914 --> 00:17:31.144
You’ll see.

85
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.154
Iwanttoseea priest

86
00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:04.176
-Whydid she have to die?
- Only GcxJ can answer that.

87
00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:07.810
I knowJesus says
to Ioveyour enemies, but I can’t

88
00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:12.016
I just want the English
to bum in hell forever and ever!

89
00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.587
I realize your angerjeanne.

90
00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:18.186
But we must learn to forgive.
It’s hard...

91
00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:21.960
but revenge will never
bring axut ace.

92
00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:24.628
Whatwill?
And what will bring her back?

93
00:18:24.703 --> 00:18:28.605
And whydid she have to die
¡n the first place instead of me?

94
00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:31.302
Why didn’t He take my life
instead of hers?

95
00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:33.970
It was my fault!
Iwas late!

96
00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:38.540
She gave me
Whydid
her hiding place!
He save me?

97
00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:41.711
Calm down,Jeanne.
Calnm diin.

98
00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:47.922
I don’t pretend
to know God’s will...

99
00:18:47.993 --> 00:18:50.826
but one thing I am sure:

100
00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:55.094
The Lord always has a gcxxi reason.

101
00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:58.568
Perhaps He chose you because
He needs you...

102
00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:01.367
for some higher calling.

103
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.307
As long as you answer that call...

104
00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:08.176
your sisterwill not
have died in vain.

105
00:19:08.247 --> 00:19:10.715
I don’twanttowait
for His call.

106
00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:12.716
Be patient

107
00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:15.275
I want to be with Him always.

108
00:19:15.354 --> 00:19:18.846
Soonyou will be able to take part
in your Holy Mass.

109
00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:22.223
When you eat of His flesh
and dnnk of His blood...

110
00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:24.285
you will be at onewith Him.

111
00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:28.459
I want to be at one with Him now.

112
00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:36.433
So, what did he say?

113
00:19:36.508 --> 00:19:39.409
He says we must bring her to church
whenever she wants.

114
00:19:39.478 --> 00:19:42.845
Easy for him. He’s not the one
who has to do the bringing.

115
00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:45.042
Come on.
This ¡s ¡mportant.

116
00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:48.314
We mustn’t let her out of our sight

117
00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:52.289
Don’t worry. I will watch her
like my own shadow.

118
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.209
I want to be at one with You now.

119
00:21:15.741 --> 00:21:18.209
A message for the dauphin of France.

120
00:21:27.719 --> 00:21:29.346
A message.

121
00:21:38.897 --> 00:21:41.525
Captain, a message for the dauphin.

122
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.000
III take ¡t.

123
00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:52.736
The dauphin!
The dauphin!

124
00:22:07.392 --> 00:22:11.294
Louis. Louis. Hey.
Shouldn’t you be learning your lessons?

125
00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:13.422
I don’t want to learn.
Iwant to fight.

126
00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:17.400
You will. But for nowyou must
at least learn towipeyour nose.

127
00:22:21.506 --> 00:22:23.133
A letter for His Majesty.

128
00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:32.315
Another one from this girl
calling herself the Maiden of Lorraine.

129
00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:34.579
I can read for myself,
you know?

130
00:22:34.653 --> 00:22:38.248
She pretends she’s been sent by God.
Charlatans.

131
00:22:38.323 --> 00:22:40.450
It’s a pity there isn’t enough wcxxi
to bum them all.

132
00:22:40.525 --> 00:22:43.426
- She says she’ll be here tomorrow.
- You mustn’t see her, My Lord.

133
00:22:43.495 --> 00:22:47.124
<No OCR content on this page>

134
00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:49.429
What difference does it make
where she comes from?

135
00:22:49.501 --> 00:22:51.560
If she comes from Burgundy,
¡t makes a difference.

136
00:22:51.636 --> 00:22:54.196
It might be a trap.
Lcxk, signed X

137
00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:55.762
What sort of a name ¡s X’?

138
00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:59.038
Or must we assume that a messenger
of God can’t even write her own name?

139
00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:02.376
My Lord, Trémoille ¡s correct.
She says she hears voices.

140
00:23:02.447 --> 00:23:04.847
She may be a sorceress,
a witch.

141
00:23:04.916 --> 00:23:08.181
Regnault, you see witches everywhere.

142
00:23:08.253 --> 00:23:10.448
She’s just a peasant

143
00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:13.821
A peasant who cares about her king.

144
00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:18.192
All she wants ¡s to see me crowned
and permission to fight for me.

145
00:23:18.263 --> 00:23:22.097
Not exactly. She wants you
to give her an army at your expense.

146
00:23:22.167 --> 00:23:25.398
Bearing ¡n mind your mother stole every
last piece of gold ¡n the treasury...

147
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.700
I fail to see how you can afford
such an adventure.

148
00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:29.707
I can see heriflwantto.

You mustn’t see her,
Your Majesty.

153

She may be an ¡nstrument
of the devil.

154
00:23:43.722 --> 00:23:45.553
Well, I thinkyou should.

155
00:23:52.464 --> 00:23:54.398
Well, here’s an amusing situation.

156
00:23:54.466 --> 00:23:58.129
I would lcwe to know why my devoted
mother-in-law thinks one thing...

157
00:23:58.203 --> 00:24:01.536
and my two most loyal
and trusted advisors...

158
00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:03.540
think precisely the opxsite.

159
00:24:03.608 --> 00:24:07.669
Because I care atxut you.
Come here.

160
00:24:18.523 --> 00:24:21.549
Your health and happiness has always
been my first concern, Charles...

165
00:24:30.735 --> 00:24:34.068
I know, for exam pl e,
the sickness that plagues your heart

166
00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:37.302
I knowhowpainfulitis
for you to have loved a father...

167
00:24:37.375 --> 00:24:41.106
without ever knowing
if he was reallyyours.

168
00:24:42.714 --> 00:24:45.114
Do I know you enough? Hmm?

169
00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:49.549
What has that got to do
with this maiden?

170
00:24:49.621 --> 00:24:53.921
Who better than a messenger from Gcxi
to give answers to your questions?

171
00:24:55.193 --> 00:24:57.753
You think she was sent from God?

172
00:24:57.829 --> 00:24:59.922
You’re a fine judge
of character, Charles.

173
00:24:59.998 --> 00:25:02.899
Itil take you less than five minutes
to exse her if she’s a fake.

174
00:25:04.102 --> 00:25:06.696
But ¡f she’s noL

175
00:25:08.807 --> 00:25:11.275
then she will giveyou
your answers...

176
00:25:13.578 --> 00:25:15.773
and place the crown on your head.

177
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:22.211
With respect to my lady, I think it’s
going to take more than a peasant girl—

178
00:25:22.287 --> 00:25:24.551
I’m not interested
¡n what you think, Trémoille...

179
00:25:24.623 --> 00:25:26.181
<No OCR content on this page>

180
00:25:26.258 --> 00:25:29.091
<No OCR content on this page>

181
00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:34.564
simple people up and down this country
are already talking axut her.

182
00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:37.033
Now you know
what simple people are like--

183
00:25:37.102 --> 00:25:39.900
always ready to believe
any old prophecy.

184
00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:45.909
Like this one...

185
00:25:45.977 --> 00:25:49.344
axut a virgin from Lorraine...

186
00:25:49.414 --> 00:25:52.110
saving France.

187
00:25:56.154 --> 00:25:57.746
And now...

188
00:25:59.024 --> 00:26:01.891
this girl comes along...

189
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.552
from Lorraine.

190
00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:08.627
And suddenly, there’s a spark
of hope ¡n their simple minds.

191
00:26:16.775 --> 00:26:19.039
You shouldn’t disappoint them.

192
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.477
If they believe ¡n her—

193
00:26:22.547 --> 00:26:26.415
¡f she can put back
the fire ¡n ourarmy—

194
00:26:26.484 --> 00:26:29.009
then I believe ¡n her too.

195
00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:46.195
R

196
00:26:49.207 --> 00:26:51.300
Louis, be quiet for once.

197
00:27:09.327 --> 00:27:11.761
- She’s coming, Your Majesty.
-All right.

198
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.422
Calm yourself.

199
00:27:14.332 --> 00:27:16.562
Your Majesty, I urge you
not to see this woman.

200
00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:18.569
It all reeks oía Burgundian trap.

201
00:27:18.637 --> 00:27:23.165
My astrologers assure me the timing
is propitious: Leo with Virgo rising.

202
00:27:23.241 --> 00:27:26.540
Have you never noticed
on the astrological chart..

203
00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:29.102
that the virgin
is next to the lion?

204
00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.114
Supposing she’s an assassin?

205
00:27:32.417 --> 00:27:34.908
My-My-My dear Trémoille...

206
00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:36.920
I’m not even kingyet.

207
00:27:36.988 --> 00:27:39.081
Who would want to assassinate me?

208
00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:33.533
She’s arrived, My Lord.
She’s ¡n the guards’ rm.

209
00:28:33.611 --> 00:28:34.942
Fine, fine.

210
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.878
I supxse I shall have
to make a decision.

211
00:28:51.563 --> 00:28:53.861
Why ¡s life so complicated?

212
00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:58.400
Sometimes I really wish
I could be someone else.

213
00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:02.606
That’s a gxxi idea, sire.

214
00:29:06.444 --> 00:29:08.071
What doyou mean?

215
00:29:08.146 --> 00:29:10.979
Let someone else
pretend to be you.

216
00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:14.143
And see ¡f she can find me?
That’s a brilliant idea.

Alençon, my noble duke.

228

My royal cousin.
So fine, so brave, so rich.

234
00:30:28.259 --> 00:30:32.457
You would be perfect
to sit on mythrone.

235
00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:35.988
So perfect that you might
like it t much...

236
00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:39.468
and therefore disturb
my-my fragile ace of mind.

237
00:30:44.609 --> 00:30:46.372
La Hire.

238
00:30:46.444 --> 00:30:49.902
My angry captain,
and bravest in France.

239
00:30:49.981 --> 00:30:53.747
Scarred bya dozen wars, butwith
a heart and a stomach for a dozen more.

240
00:30:53.818 --> 00:30:56.616
-You could pass for the king.
- Damn bloody right I could.

241
00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:58.656
Until you open your mouth,
because no one...

242
00:30:58.723 --> 00:31:01.157
with a tongue like that
could Fxssible pass as king of France.

243
00:31:12.337 --> 00:31:15.306
It looks like it shall have
to be me after all.

244

<No OCR content on this page>

245
00:31:22.146 --> 00:31:24.478
The only man
who’s poorer than I am...

246
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:26.847
therefore the only man
I can trust.

247
00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:31.951
Dignified, honorable, wise.

248
00:31:32.023 --> 00:31:34.355
What more can we ask oía king?

249
00:31:40.198 --> 00:31:41.790
My lord, I’m not sure that—

250
00:31:41.866 --> 00:31:43.333
Are you not prepared
to die foryour king?

251
00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:44.663
- Of course I am.
- G.

252
00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:47.830
Until then, feel free to live
like a king. Bring her up.

253
00:31:58.116 --> 00:32:01.176
Sireyou know how bad lam
at this sort of game.

254
00:32:01.252 --> 00:32:03.186
Pretend it’s not a game.

255
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:07.314
Make way for the dauphin.

256
00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:18.068
- Mother?
- Not now.

257
00:33:11.456 --> 00:33:13.515
I have come to see the dauphin.

258
00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:08.177
Who are you?

259

<No OCR content on this page>

260
00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:15.478
His most gracious majesty,
Charles de Valois...

261
00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:17.487
dauphin of France.

262
00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:40.609
I can see you are a gcxxi man.

263
00:34:40.678 --> 00:34:42.270
But you’re not the dauphin.

264
00:34:46.884 --> 00:34:50.183
I’m sorry to insist,
but I must see the dauphin.

265
00:34:50.254 --> 00:34:52.984
We have no time to lose.
Where is he?

266
00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:58.786
He’s here.
Find him yourself.

<No OCR content on this page>

268
00:36:41.632 --> 00:36:44.726
There’s no need to be afraid, sire.

269
00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:48.429
I’m not the king.

270
00:36:48.506 --> 00:36:53.341
I knowyou’renotyet,
butyou will bescxn.

271
00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.683
Out. Out.

272

How didyou knowwho lam?

273
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:14.298
- Her voices, of course.
- That’s him, they said.

274
00:37:14.365 --> 00:37:17.129
‘The one ¡n the comer
with the big nose.’

275
00:37:23.808 --> 00:37:24.866
Back offi

276
00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:32.147
Oh, my gentle dauphin.

277
00:37:41.125 --> 00:37:43.059
I have a message...

278
00:37:43.127 --> 00:37:46.153
from the King of Heaven...

279
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:48.289
foryou.

280
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.961
You only.

281
00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:02.639
Follow me.

282
00:38:04.148 --> 00:38:06.013
Your Majesty, I really think—

283
00:38:06.083 --> 00:38:10.645
My dear loyal Trémoille,
I know I can count on you...

284
00:38:10.721 --> 00:38:12.882
to-to ensure our privacy.

285
00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:15.983
I need to talk to her alone.

286
00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:23.996
He needs to talk to her alone.

287
00:38:24.068 --> 00:38:25.660
Fine.

288
00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:45.012
I was ax,ut ten years old.

289
00:38:45.089 --> 00:38:47.922
It was a beautiftil spring day.

290
00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:50.290
I was taking a shortcut home
through the forest..

291
00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:54.730
when a strange wind...

292
00:38:54.799 --> 00:38:56.767
began to blow.

293
00:39:05.042 --> 00:39:09.069
It was such a strange soun4
almost ilke wojT..

294
00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:11.410
calling me.

295
00:39:30.668 --> 00:39:32.602
The second time...

296
00:39:33.938 --> 00:39:35.769
was manyyears later.

297
00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.970
I was coming back from church,
when suddenly...

298
00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:42.342
the same...

299
00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:45.940
violent wind.

300
00:39:50.988 --> 00:39:52.580
Then...

301
00:39:54.392 --> 00:39:56.860
a shape..

302
00:39:56.927 --> 00:39:58.519
appeared..

303
00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:03.325
in the middle of the sky.

304
00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:05.767
The shape...

305
00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:07.428
<No OCR content on this page>

306
00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:10.200
of a man.

307
00:40:24.455 --> 00:40:27.947
Everything was moving so fast.
So fast.

308
00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:32.061
The wind, the clouds.

309
00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:36.962
I couldn’t move.
I couldn’t breathe.

310
00:40:38.235 --> 00:40:42.001
I was so frightened.

311
00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.698
He was...

<No OCR content on this page>

316
00:41:04.261 --> 00:41:08.095
But Idid not understand
what it was He wanted me to do.

317
00:41:08.165 --> 00:41:11.760
What was my mission?
What could I do to help my country?

318
00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:15.294
But how? I was nothing.
I was justa pcorgirl.

319
00:41:15.372 --> 00:41:20.105
I did not know anything atxut—
axut making war or riding.

320
00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:23.874
Sol decided towait...

321
00:41:23.948 --> 00:41:26.883
and not to speak of it
to anybody.

322
00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:29.351
You did well.
You did well.

323
00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:32.048
I didn’t wait long.

324
00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:38.387
I was going to Mass,
like I do every day...

325
00:41:38.462 --> 00:41:41.454
and the same...

326
00:41:41.532 --> 00:41:44.729
strange wind—

327
00:42:13.063 --> 00:42:15.930
Everything was made clear.

328
00:42:18.235 --> 00:42:20.396
GcxJ had given me a message.

329
00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:24.437
A message to deliver.

330
00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:29.812
What—

331
00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.472
What was the message?

332
00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:43.057
He said...

333
00:42:43.127 --> 00:42:46.585
that I must save France
from her enemies...

334
00:42:46.664 --> 00:42:49.462
and bring her back
into the hands of God.

335
00:42:49.533 --> 00:42:52.866
And He told me that I...

336
00:42:52.937 --> 00:42:55.303
<No OCR content on this page>

337
00:42:55.372 --> 00:42:58.102
will lead you
to the altar at Reims...

338
00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:03.179
where you will be crowned...

339
00:43:04.548 --> 00:43:06.140
the king...

340
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:13.181
of France.

341
00:43:37.147 --> 00:43:39.047
- Sire, are you—
- I’m fine.

342
00:43:41.518 --> 00:43:45.352
This is, in fact,Jean d’Aulon,
my loyal friend and finest archer.

343
00:43:45.422 --> 00:43:47.652
I put her ¡n your care.

Sire, I won’t be needing any Icxigings
¡f we’re to be marching on Orléans.

347
00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:58.893
Orleans has held out
fôr six months...

348
00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:01.733
so I don’t supse a few days more
will make much difference.

349
00:44:01.805 --> 00:44:03.397
Take some rest.

350
00:44:10.948 --> 00:44:12.677
Put the bags here.

351
00:44:15.019 --> 00:44:17.180
Please accept my apologies...

352
00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:19.688
for me pretending
to be the—you know.

353
00:44:19.757 --> 00:44:21.691
Do you think
that I can have some water?

354
00:44:21.759 --> 00:44:24.523
Water. Yes, of course.

355
00:44:24.595 --> 00:44:26.529
Would you get some water?

356
00:44:26.597 --> 00:44:29.065
-Anything else?
-l needtoseea priest.

357
00:44:29.133 --> 00:44:33.194
- Now?
- Yes. I didn’t confess today.

358
00:44:34.438 --> 00:44:38.465
All right
Raymond, a priest.

359
00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:39.531
Anything else?

360
00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:42.204
I shall alsobe needing
a new war horse...

361
00:44:42.279 --> 00:44:45.146
a sword, armor...

362
00:44:45.215 --> 00:44:47.740
<No OCR content on this page>

363
00:44:47.818 --> 00:44:50.651
-Now?
- Better today than tomorrow.

364
00:44:50.721 --> 00:44:53.281
This might take a little time...

365
00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:56.986
but let me see what I can do.

366
00:44:57.061 --> 00:45:00.997
Oh! I shall also be needing someone
who can read and write.

367
00:45:01.065 --> 00:45:03.033
This Ican do.

368
00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:06.092
I was studying at the University
of Pans until the English invaded it.

369
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:08.832
- I thought you were an archer.
-Yes, lam.

370
00:45:08.906 --> 00:45:13.502
<No OCR content on this page>

371
00:45:13.577 --> 00:45:15.636
The king of England.

372
00:45:17.715 --> 00:45:20.775
I want to give him the chance
to leave in peace...

373
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.083
before I get to Orléans.

374
00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:39.427
The’ archbishop andi hai.tjust begun
negotiat/oiis with the 8urgundians

375
00:45:39.503 --> 00:45:41.198
If we can bring them over
to our side—

376
00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:45.002
Negotiate, by all means,
but from a position of strength.

377
00:45:45.075 --> 00:45:47.771
If the English take Orleans,
there’ll be nothing left to negotiate.

378
00:45:47.845 --> 00:45:49.779
The rest of the country
will be theirs.

379
00:45:49.847 --> 00:45:52.714
My lady, ¡twill be
the height of folly...

380
00:45:52.783 --> 00:45:55.809
to let this child
lead our army...

381
00:45:55.886 --> 00:46:00.152
¡n the kings name
without verifying her true motives.

382
00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:01.691
My Lord, Trémoille ¡s right

383
00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:06.162
We must be absolutely certain that
she ¡s not an instrument of the devil.

384
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:10.166
How can anyone be
absolutely certain axut anything?

385
00:46:12.202 --> 00:46:15.638
Sometimes, our intuitions
are our best counselors.

386
00:46:15.706 --> 00:46:19.574
We must listen to Mother Holy Church
before we listen to our intuitions.

387
00:46:25.749 --> 00:46:26.807
Wait.

388
00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:32.113
She claims to be a virgin.

389
00:46:32.189 --> 00:46:34.885
Well, that’s something
we can examine...

390
00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:38.325
and be absolutely certain atxut

391
00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:57.579
Let’s find out.

392
00:49:29.766 --> 00:49:32.098
What ¡f she’s not?

393
00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:35.935
If she’s not,
I’ll kill her myself.

394
00:49:46.416 --> 00:49:50.011
There is nosign
of corruption or violation.

395
00:49:50.087 --> 00:49:52.112
She ¡s ¡ntact

396
00:49:55.926 --> 00:50:00.488
And what, exactly,
was this vision wearing?

397
00:50:00.564 --> 00:50:02.088
I don’t remember.

398
00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:04.963
This vision,
did it give you anything?

399
00:50:05.035 --> 00:50:07.902
An object?
A ring ora rosary...

400
00:50:07.971 --> 00:50:11.805
or anything bywhich
we can venfýyour claim?

401
00:50:11.875 --> 00:50:13.536
He gave me gcxd advice.

402
00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:17.102
During your childhcxxi, did you have
any sort of military experience?

403
00:50:18.582 --> 00:50:21.050
Are you practiced ¡n the skills
of swordsmanship?

404
00:50:21.118 --> 00:50:24.110
No, but I’m gocxi with a stick.

405
00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:30.960
Doyou know what
a Dijon Culvenn is?

406
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:34.930
It’s an item of artillery.

407
00:50:34.998 --> 00:50:37.262
How can you expect
to raise the siege of Orléans...

408
00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:39.325
¡f you’re ignorant
axut mcxiem artillery?

409
00:50:39.403 --> 00:50:44.102
The road to Orléans is long,
and I have gcxxi captains with me.

410
00:50:44.174 --> 00:50:46.165
Iwill learn fast believe me.

411
00:50:46.243 --> 00:50:49.144
Wewould like to believeyou,Jeanne,
but we feel...

412
00:50:49.212 --> 00:50:51.942
that ¡f GcxJ wanted us
to believe you...

413
00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:55.348
he would’ve sent a sign with you.

414
00:50:55.419 --> 00:50:59.150
So, can you do something?

415
00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:03.325
Show us something?

416
00:51:04.961 --> 00:51:08.328
A sign to prove...

417
00:51:08.398 --> 00:51:10.332
that you are sent by GcxJ.

418
00:51:11.935 --> 00:51:15.769
I did not come here
to perform tricks.

419
00:51:18.341 --> 00:51:21.276
You are all much cleverer
than I am.

420
00:51:21.344 --> 00:51:24.780
I mean, me,
I dont know A from B.’

428
00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:52.770
through 500 leagues of enemy country
to bnng you His help.

429
00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:54.868
Is that not prcxf enough?

430
00:52:00.217 --> 00:52:03.015
Or do you still need more signs?

431
00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:10.859
Give me an army.

432
00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:16.125
Take me to Orléans.

433
00:52:19.736 --> 00:52:22.534
And there you will see the sign
that I was sent to make.

434
00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:53.361
Dunois.

435
00:52:53.436 --> 00:52:57.236
- What?
- A big one, straight at us.

436
00:52:59.676 --> 00:53:01.041
What side?

437
00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:02.976
<No OCR content on this page>

438
00:53:18.495 --> 00:53:19.484
What?

439
00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:23.698
I have wonderful news, finally.

440
00:53:23.767 --> 00:53:26.736
He is sending her to us.
Thanks be to God. We’re saved.

441
00:53:26.803 --> 00:53:28.293
It’s—
It’s wonderñil.

442
00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:31.340
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.
Who has finally done what?

443
00:53:31.408 --> 00:53:34.809
The dauphin. He’s sending us
fcxxi and supplies and an army...

444
00:53:34.878 --> 00:53:37.608
led byjeanne,
the maiden from Lorraine.

445
00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:39.979
Isn’t ¡t wonderful?

446
00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:41.984
Yes, it’s a miracle.

447
00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:48.923
I can’t believe
they are sending a woman.

448
00:53:50.026 --> 00:53:52.790
I wonder what color dress
she’ll beweanng.

Yes, we were.

455
00:54:24.961 --> 00:54:27.657
- Where are the English?
- Everywhere. Where’s the fcxxi?

456
00:54:27.731 --> 00:54:30.427
It’s coming.
I rode on ahead.

457
00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:33.492
I have a message
for the captain of the English army.

458
00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.037
- His name ¡s TaILxt.
-Iknow.

459
00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:38.939
- Canyou take me to him?
- He’s on the other side of the river.

460
00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:42.308
So, who gave the order for me
to be brought to this side of the river?

461
00:54:43.647 --> 00:54:47.549
Hey, my friend. It’s gcxxi
to see your ugly damn face again.

462
00:54:47.617 --> 00:54:50.848
- La Hire, I’m warning you. Don’t swear.
- Sorry,Jeanne.

463
00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:55.653
Let me ¡ntrcxiuce the king’s
half-brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.

464
00:54:56.926 --> 00:55:00.089
Lord Dunois, will you show me
to the other side of the river?

465
00:55:00.163 --> 00:55:02.859
Wait. Waili

466
00:55:05.969 --> 00:55:09.234
Fine! Go now, ¡fyou want!
But not with me!

467
00:55:09.306 --> 00:55:12.901
You may have a dutyto God,
but I have a duty to my people.

468
00:55:12.976 --> 00:55:15.570
And my people are starving.

469
00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:18.478
Right now, rm going to take
the fcxxi back to the city.

470
00:55:18.548 --> 00:55:21.676
And ¡fyou can please calm down
and let me accompanyyou to Orleans...

471
00:55:21.751 --> 00:55:23.685
twill bemyhonor
to welcome you.

472
00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:25.838
Jesus Christ

473
00:56:25.915 --> 00:56:27.849
The goddamn English
will pay for this.

474
00:56:27.917 --> 00:56:31.944
Yes, theywill, and so will you
if you don’t stop swearing.

475
00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:52.969
Come on. rm happy
towelcomeyou ¡n my tavern.

476
00:56:53.042 --> 00:56:54.771
Come on ¡n.

477
00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:00.014
La Hire, Gules,
let me show you something.

478
00:57:08.558 --> 00:57:12.119
Tourelles are around here.
The river crosses there.

479
00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:19.997
Calm down.
You can’t blame those people.

480
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:21.536
They’ve been hearing
axut you for weeks.

481
00:57:21.604 --> 00:57:24.801
There’s nothing to hear!
And why is there nothing to hear?

482
00:57:24.874 --> 00:57:27.399
Because I haven’t done anything!
And why haven’t I?

483
00:57:27.477 --> 00:57:29.809
‘Cause none of you
will listen to me!

484
00:57:35.151 --> 00:57:37.085
Why don’tyou join us?

485
00:57:38.321 --> 00:57:40.255
We’re atxut to discuss
the campaign.

486
00:57:41.658 --> 00:57:43.819
I’m sorry.

487
00:57:43.893 --> 00:57:46.157
So from here,
Taftxt has spread his forces...

488
00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:48.322
between these forts up here.

489
00:57:48.398 --> 00:57:50.866
But ¡n the last few days ¡t seems,
according to our scouts...

490
00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:53.562
that some trps have been
deployed to this fort here.

491
00:57:53.636 --> 00:57:55.399
What axut this huge pile down here?

492
00:57:55.472 --> 00:57:57.497
That’s the Tourelles.
The English were planning...

493
00:57:57.574 --> 00:58:00.668
to launch an attack from ¡t,
but then we broke down the bridge--

And what doesJeanne think?

499
00:58:14.524 --> 00:58:18.221
I don’t think.
I leave that to God.

500
00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:21.388
lam nothing in all of this.
Im just the messenger.

501
00:58:21.464 --> 00:58:23.022
SOrn

502
00:58:23.099 --> 00:58:25.033
what ¡s the message?

503
00:58:25.101 --> 00:58:28.559
We give the English...

504
00:58:28.638 --> 00:58:31.163
a last chance
to go home ¡n ace.

505
00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:32.731
And ¡f they reftise?

506
00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:34.401
If they reftise...

507
00:58:36.779 --> 00:58:38.838
we recross the river...

508
00:58:40.083 --> 00:58:42.745
and attack here...

509
00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:44.218
at the Tourelles.

510
00:58:45.889 --> 00:58:49.290
That makes no sense at all.
The Tourelles ¡s virtually impregnable.

511
00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:52.590
If we are on the other side of the river
attacking the Tourelles...

512
00:58:52.662 --> 00:58:56.120
what’s to stop TaItxt
attacking the city from the north?

513
00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:59.828
-God.
- God. Why, of course.

514
00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:03.498

516
00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:13.514
but by tomorrow night,
some of you will be dead.

517
00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:16.643
With
attack
respect, we can’t just
the Tourelles like that.

518
00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:20.211
- It’s a very complicated matter.
- What’s so complicated axut it?

519
00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:24.750
All you have to do ¡s what you’re told.
What could be simpler than that?

520
00:59:24.827 --> 00:59:27.091
lam the drum...

521
00:59:27.163 --> 00:59:29.097
on which Gcxi is beating out
His message.

522
00:59:29.165 --> 00:59:32.191
He’s beating ¡t so hard,
it’s bursting my ears!

523
00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:34.759
<No OCR content on this page>

524
00:59:34.837 --> 00:59:38.204
I mean, for our pride
to suddenly be usurped by--

525
00:59:42.845 --> 00:59:46.804
Well, with all due respect,
bya-

526
00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:48.680
bya girl.

527
00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:56.286
So that’s ¡t.

528
00:59:56.359 --> 01:00:00.887
To you, Im just a girl.

Putyourselfin my shoes fora moment
How would you feel ¡fyou were me?

530
01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:09.963

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:12.906
enormous gratitude.

532
01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.407
One hell of a girl. huh?

533
01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:26.984
I warned you.

534
01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:35.023
I do love her when
gets well and truly
herfire
stoked.

535
01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:36.895
Me too.

536
01:00:38.568 --> 01:00:41.059
Hello, my friends!

537
01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:43.696
What a journey.

538
01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:45.707
But we made ¡t.

539
01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:49.044
Back together again.
Let’s have some fun.

540
01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:56.442
Fine.
I shall look like a man.

541

R

542
01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.786
How dare you stop me
from doing God’s will!

543
01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:08.922
He didn’t tell you
to cut all your hairoffi

544
01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:11.296
How dare you tell me
what God tells me to do!

545
01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:14.336
Whatever! But since He’s not going
to come down and cut it Himself--

546
01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:16.372
At least let someone
cut ¡t properly!

547
01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:21.375
Raymond, bring the scissors.

548
01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:23.912
Louis, fetch the mirror.

549
01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:30.341
Stop getting so angry aLxut everything.
Calm down.

550
01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:34.015

It’s GcxJ that’s angry.

551
01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:36.718
I need to send a letter, now.

What did they say?

573
01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:52.723
They said
they’ll think axut ¡t.

574
01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:55.861
Good.

575
01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:58.702
To be honest,
I don’t think they’ll leave tomorrow.

576
01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:05.413
I can’t wait for tomorrow.

577
01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:35.076
French blcxxi is spilling.

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:41.879
Wake up! Hurry!

579
01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:46.588
They’ve started the battle
without me.

580
01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:56.261
There’s a battle to fight
and awarto bewon.

581

Open the gate!

585
01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:35.134
What happened?
Who gave the order to attack?

586
01:04:35.204 --> 01:04:37.604
Gxi knows.
It was a bad idea.

587
01:04:37.673 --> 01:04:39.573
Were the men confessed?
Where are the priests?

588
01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:42.770
We didn’t take them.
We wanted to make a surprise attack.

589
01:04:42.845 --> 01:04:45.177
Dunois, was it you
who gave the order to attack?

590
01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:49.408
- Answer me!
- Can we discuss this later?

591
01:04:49.485 --> 01:04:51.783
Sooner ¡s better than later.

592
01:04:51.854 --> 01:04:53.446
Wait!

593
01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:57.693
You’ll be killed!

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:11.429
Follow me!

Close it!

597
01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.651
Close the drawbridge!

598
01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:48.667
To the drawbridge!

599
01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:54.845
- What ¡s she doing?
- To the drawbridge!

600
01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:57.317
- The drawbridge ¡s closed.
- Not for long.

601
01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:07.156
Let’s go!

602

<No OCR content on this page>

603
01:07:49.398 --> 01:07:53.129
It’s a great victory—
yourvictory—

604
01:07:53.202 --> 01:07:54.897
but we must follow ¡t through
and pursue the English...

605
01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:57.962
back to Taftxt’s camp unless,
of course, you have another gcxd idea.

606
01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:01.840
First, we find
the biggest army we can.

607
01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:04.004
- Then we return to Orléans.
-The bridge has been pulled down.

608
01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.607
-The English are rebuilding ¡t.
- And how do you know?

609
01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:11.949
You have been with your counsel,
and I have been with mine.

610

611

- That’s the Tourelles.
- Wonderful.

613
01:09:23.659 --> 01:09:25.251
Captain!

614
01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.294
Lcxks like the froggy whore’s
coming to pay us a visit.

615
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:35.962
I’d better tell Glasdale.

616
01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:42.877
Let’s put the horses over there.

617
01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:51.481
Fathers, please, bless them.

618
01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:54.045
- Please, bless them all.
-Wewill.

619
01:10:09.705 --> 01:10:12.299
Let’s plan this attack a little more
carefully than this morning.

620
01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:13.966
Good idea.

621
01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:20.006
<No OCR content on this page>

622
01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:24.751
We’ve got, uh, visitors.

623

Doyou hear me?

625
01:10:50.546 --> 01:10:52.810
You, who call me a whore...

626
01:10:52.881 --> 01:10:56.544
I feel pity foryou,
for your soul...

627
01:10:56.619 --> 01:10:59.213
and for the souls of your men!

628
01:10:59.288 --> 01:11:03.384
Yield! Yield now
to the King of Heaven!

629
01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:06.394
Or go back to your island!

630
01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:10.023
And you, go back to your pigsty!

631
01:11:16.872 --> 01:11:18.464
Man the walls.

632
01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:42.456
This morning...

633
01:11:42.531 --> 01:11:44.761
GcxJ gave usa great victory.

634
01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:52.170
But ¡t ¡s nothing compared
towhat Heis readytogiveus now.

635
01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:56.177
I knowyouareall

but I swear toyou...

637
01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:03.611
that even ¡f these English were hanging
from the clouds by their fingertips...

638
01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:06.211
we would pull them down
before nightfall.

639
01:12:08.123 --> 01:12:09.613
Now...

640
01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:12.354

641
01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:16.124

Hey, you just killed mywoman!

Go to hell.

01:16:37.626 --> 01:16:40.254
Call the physician!
The physician!

671
01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:41.921
Damn it!

672
01:16:43.632 --> 01:16:44.997
Louis, find the physician.

673
01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:48.332
We have to take out the arrow.

674
01:16:48.403 --> 01:16:50.337
<No OCR content on this page>

675
01:16:50.405 --> 01:16:52.999
There must be something we can do
for her, for Christ’s sakes.

676
01:16:53.075 --> 01:16:56.670
-Yes. You can pray.
-Good idea.

677
01:16:59.214 --> 01:17:03.150
I swear that I will
never swearagain in my life...

678
01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:05.311
¡f You save her life.

679
01:17:05.387 --> 01:17:07.651
But I’m warning You,
if You let her die...

680
01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:09.247
then You’re the biggest—

681
01:17:14.396 --> 01:17:16.921
- Don’t swear.
- He heard me.

682
01:17:19.901 --> 01:17:21.528
<No OCR content on this page>

683
01:17:21.603 --> 01:17:23.537
Why aren’t you fighting?

684
01:17:23.605 --> 01:17:25.368
You’ve been badly wounded.

685
01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:28.671
- It’s nothing. It’s—
— It’s an arrow.

686
01:17:28.744 --> 01:17:31.110
And it’s ¡n deep.

687
01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:39.411
You must staystill
till the physician arrives.

688
01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:43.254
Physicians are a waste of time.
We’ll have more luck with this charm.

689
01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:45.623
It saved my life at Agincourt

690
01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:48.458
I’d rather die than use magic.

691
01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:51.055
You will die ¡f that arrow
stays ¡n you much longer.

692
01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:18.486
Well, at least this
won’t txther us anymore.

693
01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:24.057
Now, let’s go to the battle!

694
01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:29.466
Please!

695
01:18:32.908 --> 01:18:35.001
She’s nuts.

696
01:18:35.077 --> 01:18:37.637
You must staycaim.
You must rest.

697
01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:39.943
I’ll rest.

698
01:18:40.015 --> 01:18:42.142
But you have to...

699
01:18:42.217 --> 01:18:44.117
promise me...

700
01:18:44.186 --> 01:18:48.452
that you’ll-
that you’ll go back to the battle.

701
01:18:48.523 --> 01:18:50.991
I promise.

702
01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:02.537
Hurry!

703
01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:04.196
QuickJy
Do something!

704
01:19:16.718 --> 01:19:17.878
She’s sleeping.

705
01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:19.545
What?

706
01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:33.129
Come on back!
Why areyou running away?

707
01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:38.172
<No OCR content on this page>

708
01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:41.767
- We have to press on the attack.
- Sound the retreat.

709
01:19:41.843 --> 01:19:44.368
- I promised Jeanne we’d fight on.
- I made no such promise.

710
01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:47.882
- Sound the retreat for the night.
- No, that was her order.

711
01:19:47.949 --> 01:19:50.975
I’m fed up
with taking her orders!

712
01:19:51.052 --> 01:19:53.816
She swore she’d defeat
the English before nightfall!

713
01:19:53.889 --> 01:19:58.087
Instead, she goes and plays the fcxl,
gets herself nearly killed!

714
01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:01.095
Lcxk!
Look at the mess we’re ¡n!

715
01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:03.222
<No OCR content on this page>

716
01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:06.358
We are worse off
than ¡f she’d never come at all.

717
01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:10.131
Now do as Isay
and sound the retreat!

718
01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:20.747
Where are you going?
Hey, come back!

719
01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:23.216
Come back and fight!

720
01:20:43.305 --> 01:20:46.274
-What areyou making?
- A message for the English.

721
01:20:51.546 --> 01:20:54.379
So, what are the men saying?

722
01:20:54.449 --> 01:20:57.179
She’s a gift from God

723
01:20:57.252 --> 01:21:00.346
Some even call her a saint.

724
01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:04.153
- I’d gladly follow her through hell.
- Will you go that far ¡f she asks you?

725
01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:07.457
Of course I will,
and I’ve been there before.

726
01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.434
There’s one thing
I don’t quite understand.

727
01:21:14.502 --> 01:21:16.834
She’s been sent to us by God.

728
01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.574
Whydoes Heallow her
to be wounded so badly?

729
01:21:20.642 --> 01:21:25.079
Maybe the gxxi question ¡s,
¡s she really sent byGcxi?

730
01:21:28.216 --> 01:21:30.377
Who knows?

731
01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:32.943
God knows.

732
01:22:31.746 --> 01:22:35.045
Ooh.
Awoman with a sword.

733
01:22:42.123 --> 01:22:44.557
You’ve hurt my feelings.

734
01:23:41.883 --> 01:23:43.714
Frenchies!

735
01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:46.447
What happened to your precious angel?

736
01:23:46.521 --> 01:23:50.548
Huh?
Frenchies! Frenchies!

737
01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:53.719
I’ll tell you what happened!

738
01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:57.458
We sent the little bitch
back to hell...

739
01:23:57.532 --> 01:24:01.992
so she can go flick
with the devil!

740
01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:07.936
What are you gonna do now,
Frenchies?

741
01:24:08.009 --> 01:24:11.775
Why not come out and fight?
Come on!

742
01:24:11.846 --> 01:24:16.078
Come on!
Bastards, wake up!

743
01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:18.881
Or are you tc busy praying...

744
01:24:18.953 --> 01:24:23.322
to bring your little flicking witch
back from the dead?

745
01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:26.660
Doyou hear me?

746
01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:30.689

747
01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:37.368
I’m alive!

748
01:24:41.276 --> 01:24:44.006
May GcxJ forgive your blasphemy...

749
01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:49.015
fôri neverwill.

750
01:24:53.154 --> 01:24:54.746
I never will!

751
01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:07.167
What are you doing?
You need to rest.

752
01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:09.829
We must wake up the soldiers, now!

753
01:25:09.904 --> 01:25:12.429
My fine soldiers, wake up!

754
01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:17.336
To arms!

Wake up! Wake up!
We must fight the battle!

756

My fine soldiers,

01:25:33.561 --> 01:25:36.428
Wakeup!
The time has come!

758
01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:42.502
The battle has begun!

759
01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:45.038
-To arms!
-Yes?

760
01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:49.566
My soldiers, we need this tower up!
We need this tower up, now!

761
01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:58.211
Pull!

762
01:26:02.624 --> 01:26:06.219
- What’s going on?
- We’re taking back the Tourelles.

763
01:26:14.769 --> 01:26:16.634
Get ready

764
01:26:25.547 --> 01:26:28.107
Go wake up Glasdale.

765
01:26:44.399 --> 01:26:47.266
- What are you doing?
- Sending a message to Glasdale.

766
01:26:48.369 --> 01:26:49.961
- With that?
-Yes.

767
01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:52.563
But you’ve got ¡t back-to-front

768
01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.574
Listen, I know what I’m doing...

769
01:26:54.642 --> 01:26:59.136
so either lend a hand
or get back to bed.

770
01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:02.479
I’m going to send a message
to Glasdale t.

771
01:27:07.522 --> 01:27:08.489
My lord?

772
01:27:10.024 --> 01:27:11.082
What?

773
01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:16.322
The French witch,
she’s back from the dead.

774
01:27:16.397 --> 01:27:18.331
Hurry up, men!

775
01:27:19.601 --> 01:27:23.128
Don’t you think we should take
some time to think about this?

776
01:27:23.204 --> 01:27:25.138
Sooner ¡s better than later.

777
01:27:31.646 --> 01:27:34.672
To arms!
To arms!

778
01:27:34.749 --> 01:27:36.341
Gxxi morning.

This one.

780
01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:49.230
What the flick ¡s she playing at?

781
01:27:49.297 --> 01:27:52.994
I don’t know! The question ¡s,
what ¡s she doing now?

782
01:27:53.067 --> 01:27:56.127
How can we plan anything
¡f she doesn’t consult with us?

783
01:27:56.204 --> 01:27:58.695
- Did we consult with her yesterday?
- Don’t even start

784
01:27:58.773 --> 01:28:01.469
- You agreed to attack yesterday t.
- Yes, but that doesn’t count

785
01:28:01.542 --> 01:28:04.409
- Why ¡s that?
- Because I always agree to attack.

786
01:28:04.479 --> 01:28:05.639
To arms!

787
01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:15.518
Crazy bitch.

788
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:17.524
She doesn’t even know
how to use it.

789
01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:31.600
Oh, my God!

790
01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:43.546
- Fuck! Close the dcxrs!
- Close the doors!

791
01:28:55.096 --> 01:28:58.224

799
01:30:17.445 --> 01:30:20.346
Yes? Oh,Jeanne!

Kill her.

-Wewon?
-Won?

843
01:36:57.344 --> 01:37:00.871
No. No,Jeanne.
So small aword will neverdo.

844
01:37:00.948 --> 01:37:04.247
This ¡s victory!

845
01:37:04.318 --> 01:37:07.116
This is glory!

846
01:37:34.014 --> 01:37:35.879
What’s the matter?

847
01:37:39.887 --> 01:37:41.821
This is glory?

848
01:37:45.626 --> 01:37:47.560
Doesn’t matter.

849
01:37:54.435 --> 01:37:56.494
This ¡s not possible.

850
01:38:10.684 --> 01:38:12.174
It ¡s not possible.

851
01:38:12.253 --> 01:38:16.019
You Icxk disappointed.
Isn’t this what you wanted?

852
01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:19.753
No.
Not like this.

853
01:38:19.827 --> 01:38:22.762
For weeks you’ve been asking for this.

854
01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:25.765
<No OCR content on this page>

855
01:38:34.108 --> 01:38:35.803
-What areyou doing?
- Nothing.

856
01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:38.071
I’m just taking his teeth.

857
01:38:40.047 --> 01:38:42.982
But you just can’t kill a man
for his teeth.

858
01:38:43.050 --> 01:38:45.041
Why not? He has gcxxl teeth.

859
01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:49.284
Because—
Because you can’t!

860
01:38:51.025 --> 01:38:52.686
What about all this?

861
01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:55.388
But that’s different

862

<No OCR content on this page>

863
01:38:59.233 --> 01:39:02.600
Not me.
He’s my pnsoner...

864
01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:04.365
Ican take his teeth
¡fi want to.

865
01:39:04.438 --> 01:39:07.999
No you Œn’t!
Stop it!

866
01:39:08.075 --> 01:39:09.508
Here. Take this!

867
01:39:10.644 --> 01:39:13.613
He’s mine now.
Here, you.

868
01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:15.808
<No OCR content on this page>

869
01:39:18.018 --> 01:39:20.646
Bravo. And what ax,ut
all the other prisoners?

870
01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:23.690
- Doweletthem gotcx?
- I don’t know.

871
01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:27.152
Maybe.

872
01:39:35.135 --> 01:39:39.071
We must confess.
We must confess.

873
01:39:41.075 --> 01:39:43.976
Please, we have to be confessed.
All of us.

874
01:39:49.116 --> 01:39:52.142
I know this is not normal custom...

875
01:39:52.219 --> 01:39:54.050
but, uh—

876
01:39:58.092 --> 01:40:01.323
Everything’s gonna be fine.
He’s gonna confess us.

877
01:40:04.231 --> 01:40:06.529
Kneel. Kneel.

878
01:40:17.745 --> 01:40:19.975
Alençon brings bad news.

879
01:40:20.047 --> 01:40:24.108
Thousands of English are forming up
on the far side of the river.

880
01:40:24.184 --> 01:40:26.618
I think we should count our men
and get ready.

881
01:40:27.788 --> 01:40:28.914
Let’s go.

882
01:41:08.862 --> 01:41:10.454
111go.

883
01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:15.630
Alone.

884
01:41:44.298 --> 01:41:46.698
I have a message foryour King Henry!

885
01:41:47.868 --> 01:41:50.462
It ¡s a message from Gx!

886
01:41:51.371 --> 01:41:52.963
Go home!

887
01:41:55.843 --> 01:41:58.676
Ga naw, ¡n peace!

888
01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:03.380
Ifyou do not go now,
you will be buried ¡n this field!

889
01:42:05.819 --> 01:42:11.223
I’ve seen enough blood!

890
01:42:12.526 --> 01:42:14.460
But ¡fyou want more...

891
01:42:15.996 --> 01:42:17.623
I can’t stop you!

892
01:42:19.299 --> 01:42:23.201
I can onlywamyou
that it will be your blcxxi..

893
01:42:24.571 --> 01:42:25.765
not ours!

894
01:42:27.574 --> 01:42:31.169
I’m waiting for your answer.

895
01:42:46.493 --> 01:42:50.190
Never wait for miracles.
Stand by to attack.

896
01:43:03.076 --> 01:43:04.907
Please.

897
01:43:12.019 --> 01:43:13.748
My Lord...

898
01:43:15.155 --> 01:43:16.452
<No OCR content on this page>

899
01:43:48.222 --> 01:43:51.089
Now that’s what I call
a goddamn blocdy miracle.

900
01:43:51.158 --> 01:43:53.353
She was on her white horse alone...

901
01:43:53.427 --> 01:43:55.861
facing the whole English army,
and she drove them away...

902
01:43:55.929 --> 01:43:58.864
and now Orléans ¡s free.

903
01:44:09.409 --> 01:44:10.933
We lost Orléans.

904
01:44:12.379 --> 01:44:14.176
I want that girl.

905
01:44:17.117 --> 01:44:20.678
I want that girl burned.

906
01:44:40.774 --> 01:44:44.005
<No OCR content on this page>

907
01:44:44.077 --> 01:44:47.604
That’s meant to be a crown?
Don’t you have something more regal?

908
01:44:47.681 --> 01:44:49.706
The English txk the real one.

909
01:44:49.783 --> 01:44:53.344
It’s been muddy so long I forgot
how gcxxi ¡t Icxked cleaned up.

910
01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:56.355
But did you remember to clean up
what’s inside as well?

911
01:44:56.423 --> 01:44:59.551
I ask for a grandiose coronation,
and this ¡s what you give?

912
01:44:59.626 --> 01:45:02.390
This whole thing is going to be
an utter fiasco!

913
01:45:02.462 --> 01:45:06.091
You gave me 3 days to prepare.
Your fathers coronation took 3 months.

914
01:45:06.166 --> 01:45:07.929
He’s right.
We should call for a delay.

915
01:45:08.001 --> 01:45:10.367
No time.
We can’t hold up the ceremony.

916
01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:11.836
No telling when the English
might come back.

917
01:45:11.905 --> 01:45:15.204
Let them come. Let them see
who ¡s the true king of France.

918
01:45:24.918 --> 01:45:28.547
Those damn English. We should be
doing this in Pans in Notre Dame.

919
01:45:28.622 --> 01:45:30.783
It is much more prestigious
and twice as big.

920
01:45:30.857 --> 01:45:34.054
It is the sacred place that matters,
not the size. Correct, Bishop?

921
01:45:34.127 --> 01:45:38.029
Yes, my lady.
True kings of France must be anointed...

922
01:45:38.098 --> 01:45:40.828
in our great cathedral of Reims
with the holy oil of Clovis.

923
01:45:52.379 --> 01:45:55.109
YourGrace!
There can be no anointing.

924
01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:59.278
-What areyou talking atxut?
-The holy oil of Clovis ¡s all gone.

925
01:45:59.353 --> 01:46:00.752
Gone?
That’s impossible.

926
01:46:00.821 --> 01:46:04.621
It’s a magic oil. A miraculous oil.
It can never be exhausted.

927
01:46:04.691 --> 01:46:06.818
- Uxkforyourself.
- Problerim?

928
01:46:06.893 --> 01:46:08.884
I just don’t understand.

929
01:46:08.962 --> 01:46:12.056
The oil of ClcMs. It was quite fúlI
the last time I saw it.

930
01:46:12.132 --> 01:46:15.659
- And when was that?
- At the coronation of King Charles Vi.

931
01:46:15.736 --> 01:46:18.705
Thirtyyears ago?
Does ¡t surprise you it’s gone?

932
01:46:18.772 --> 01:46:21.673
But you don’t understand.

933
01:46:21.742 --> 01:46:25.872
It’s no ordinary oil.
It’s a miraculous oil.

934
01:46:25.946 --> 01:46:29.507
It was brought
by a white dove from heaven...

935
01:46:29.583 --> 01:46:32.450
to crown King Clovis
¡n this very cathedral.

936
01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:36.785
-What areyou doing?
- Performing a miracle.

937
01:47:56.603 --> 01:48:00.972
<No OCR content on this page>

938
01:48:01.041 --> 01:48:03.874
we do anoint thee, Charles Valois...

939
01:48:03.944 --> 01:48:08.972
to be sovereign lord and king
of this great kingdom of France...

940
01:48:09.049 --> 01:48:13.418
charging that ye should defend
the faith of our Mother Holy Church...

941
01:48:13.487 --> 01:48:16.183
as long as ye shall live.

942
01:48:17.257 --> 01:48:18.519
Amen.

943
01:48:53.293 --> 01:48:55.227
Long live the king!

944
01:49:13.146 --> 01:49:16.513
-Jeanne, are you all right?
-Yes, I’m fine.

945
01:49:19.185 --> 01:49:22.712
-Why areyou staring at me?
-You have an arrow ¡nyour leg.

946
01:49:28.461 --> 01:49:30.326
So there ¡s.

947
01:49:31.765 --> 01:49:33.824
But that doesn’t stop you
from climbing!

948
01:49:35.001 --> 01:49:38.596
Well, climb! Go! Go!

949
01:49:44.244 --> 01:49:45.802
Take this arrow out of my leg.

950
01:49:51.151 --> 01:49:52.948
Look ouU

951
01:49:54.321 --> 01:49:57.722
- Becarefùl!
-Jeanne, the men are exhausted.

952
01:49:57.791 --> 01:50:00.589
I know, but so ¡s the enemy.
They’re falling back. Pans ¡s ours.

953
01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:02.719
Jeanne, we are not enough.

954
01:50:02.796 --> 01:50:05.492
So bring up the reinforcements.

955
01:50:05.565 --> 01:50:07.533
Reinforcements? Where?

956
01:50:08.735 --> 01:50:10.703
Right behind us.

957
01:50:10.770 --> 01:50:13.500
Dunois with another 10,000 men.

958
01:50:13.573 --> 01:50:16.770
-Jeanne, look behind you.
- Never lcxk behind. Only ahead.

959
01:50:18.845 --> 01:50:21.712
Do you know how to count?

960
01:50:24.217 --> 01:50:28.051
Of course Ido!
So, bring them up!

961
01:50:30.624 --> 01:50:34.856
Jeanne, that ¡s not
10,000 reinforcements!

962
01:50:34.928 --> 01:50:36.987
That ¡s 1 00...

963
01:50:37.063 --> 01:50:39.827
very loyal
but very tired soldiers!

964
01:50:41.635 --> 01:50:44.160
But where’s Dunois?

965
01:50:44.237 --> 01:50:46.330
And where are the men
the king promised me?

966
01:50:46.406 --> 01:50:49.933
He never sent them!
Don’t you understand?

967
01:50:50.010 --> 01:50:52.171
He doesn’t want this war anymore.

968
01:50:52.245 --> 01:50:55.214
He has his crown now.
That’s all he ever wanted.

969
01:50:56.449 --> 01:50:59.509
But my voices, they promised me.

970
01:50:59.586 --> 01:51:02.316
To hell with yourvoices!

971
01:51:05.458 --> 01:51:07.858
It’s time to face facts!

972
01:51:10.196 --> 01:51:13.029
We have nothing to do here!

973
01:51:13.099 --> 01:51:15.033
None of us!

974
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:19.204
Not even you.

975
01:51:24.244 --> 01:51:26.712
You donut believe in me anymore?

976
01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:29.806
Jeanne, of course we still
believe in you.

977
01:51:29.883 --> 01:51:34.081
If it were up to me, I’d chase every
gcxidamn Englishman into the ocean.

978
01:51:34.154 --> 01:51:36.816
But it’s not up to us anymore.

979
01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:38.824
It’s up to the king.

980
01:51:50.937 --> 01:51:52.928
You should go home,Jeanne.

981
01:52:07.487 --> 01:52:11.423
We cannot possibly afford to pay
for the size of army she’s demanding.

982
01:52:11.491 --> 01:52:12.822
Girl ¡s crazy.

983
01:52:15.028 --> 01:52:17.223
Her victory at Orléans
was a miracle.

984
01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:20.789
But we can’t wait for a miracle
when we build a future for France.

985
01:52:23.336 --> 01:52:26.100
Pans was a disaster.

986
01:52:26.172 --> 01:52:28.163
God wasn’t with her then.

987
01:52:28.241 --> 01:52:31.301
If GcxJ deserts her,
what do you think we should do?

988
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:47.125
Why did you betray me? Pans was ours.
All I needed was a few hundred men.

989
01:52:47.193 --> 01:52:51.721
- Why did you take the army you gave me?
- Gave you?

990
01:52:51.798 --> 01:52:55.199
- I wouldn’t quite put it that way.
- So how would you put it?

991
01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:03.705
<No OCR content on this page>

992
01:53:03.777 --> 01:53:06.177
foryour past efforts...

993
01:53:06.246 --> 01:53:08.806
but now your task ¡s done.

994
01:53:08.882 --> 01:53:11.282
Now is the time for negotiation.

995
01:53:11.351 --> 01:53:13.581
Peace will only be got with the English
by the end of a lance.

996
01:53:13.653 --> 01:53:17.919
Why areyou so blcxxithirsty?
Do you enjoy ¡t?

997
01:53:20.493 --> 01:53:23.257
Diplomacy is far more civilized...

998
01:53:23.329 --> 01:53:26.355
far safer and far cheaper.

999
01:53:34.174 --> 01:53:38.804
I’ve letters here from towns under
siege, where your people are starving...

1000
01:53:38.878 --> 01:53:41.574
begging GcxJ on their knees
to help them.

1001
01:53:41.648 --> 01:53:45.516
I’m here to answer their prayers.
And you want to stop me?

1002
01:53:47.754 --> 01:53:51.190
<No OCR content on this page>

1003
01:53:51.257 --> 01:53:53.555
She belongs to Gcxi

1004
01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:07.405
If only she would just go home.

1005
01:54:27.026 --> 01:54:28.653
So what am I supposed to do now?

1006
01:54:29.996 --> 01:54:33.363
- What do your voices say?
- They haven’t spoken to me ¡n weeks.

1007
01:54:33.433 --> 01:54:35.628
Not since the coronation.

1008
01:54:35.702 --> 01:54:37.693
No signs, nothing.

1009
01:54:39.239 --> 01:54:41.400
Maybe their silence is a sign.

1010
01:54:42.475 --> 01:54:45.137
- Maybe it’s a sign to go home.
-No.

1011
01:54:45.211 --> 01:54:48.203
It’s not timeyet..
My mission isn’t over yet.

1012
01:54:49.616 --> 01:54:53.518
- There’s still more I have to do.
- But how do--

1013
01:54:53.586 --> 01:54:55.577
<No OCR content on this page>

1014
01:54:55.655 --> 01:54:58.715
these voices aren’t just really you?

1015
01:55:00.159 --> 01:55:04.528
Well, they are me.
That’s how GcxJ speaks to me.

1016
01:55:06.299 --> 01:55:09.860
Even you could hear them
¡fyou listened hard enough.

1017
01:55:11.537 --> 01:55:13.630
You make ¡t sound so simple.

1018
01:55:15.308 --> 01:55:17.606
So even you don’t believe in me anymore.

1019
01:55:17.677 --> 01:55:22.512
JeanneI believeinyou
more than anyone.

1020
01:55:22.582 --> 01:55:25.779
I just wish I could...

1021
01:55:25.852 --> 01:55:28.446
helpyou.

1022
01:55:28.521 --> 01:55:31.422
There ¡s one thing you can do
¡fyou want to help me.

1023
01:55:31.491 --> 01:55:32.617
Tell me.

1024
01:55:32.692 --> 01:55:35.422
<No OCR content on this page>

1025
01:55:45.872 --> 01:55:48.306
We have to stop he,, Your Myesty

1026
01:55:48.374 --> 01:55:51.639
If she Rises an army
and attacks the Burgundians...

1027
01:55:51.711 --> 01:55:54.680
months of negotiations
will have been in vain.

1028
01:55:56.115 --> 01:55:58.345
Jeanne has done so much for us.

1029
01:55:58.418 --> 01:56:01.910
I can assure you, the maid has
no greater admirer than myself.

1030
01:56:01.988 --> 01:56:04.923
Whatever our personal feelings,
we cannot allow her to conduct..

1031
01:56:04.991 --> 01:56:07.619
her own private war.

1032
01:56:07.694 --> 01:56:11.687
For the sake of the kingdom, you must
stop her from going to Corn piégne.

1033
01:56:11.764 --> 01:56:14.324
I canut stop her.

1034
01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:19.497
Well, ¡fyou don’t, I’m sure the
Burgundians would be happy to oblige.

1035
01:56:19.572 --> 01:56:22.040
If they capture her at Corn piègne-

1036
01:56:22.108 --> 01:56:24.372
No one could blame us.

1037
01:56:26.212 --> 01:56:31.047
But ¡t could sound like
we betrayed her.

1038
01:56:31.117 --> 01:56:33.585
- No, never.
- Gcxxl heavens, no.

1039
01:56:33.653 --> 01:56:35.848
Don’t worry, Charles.

1040
01:56:38.224 --> 01:56:42.593
If God ¡s still with her,
she will be victorious.

1041
01:56:42.662 --> 01:56:44.892
But her army’s so much smaller.

1042
01:56:44.964 --> 01:56:48.058
Then her faith will have to be bigger.

1043
01:57:02.448 --> 01:57:06.316
-What areyou doing? Open this gate.
- I can’t risk the safety of my town.

1044
01:57:08.855 --> 01:57:10.447
Take my banner!

1045
01:58:08.081 --> 01:58:09.480
My Lord.

1046
01:58:10.883 --> 01:58:12.714
My Lord.

1047
01:58:37.810 --> 01:58:39.573
I can’t believe ¡t.

1048
01:58:39.645 --> 01:58:44.514
<No OCR content on this page>

1049
01:58:44.584 --> 01:58:47.246
I must admit,
you have a big imagination.

1050
01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:50.050
But maybe not big enough.

1051
01:58:50.123 --> 01:58:54.389
Death ¡s much more simple.

1052
01:58:57.597 --> 01:59:01.226
After a few months,
¡t gets more interesting.

1053
01:59:03.936 --> 01:59:07.702
Then after a year,
¡t finally becomes...

1054
01:59:09.942 --> 01:59:11.773
romantic.

1055
01:59:16.649 --> 01:59:18.207
Who are you?

1056
01:59:18.284 --> 01:59:21.117
You don’t like my face?

1057
01:59:21.187 --> 01:59:23.519
Maybeyou’d prefer this one.

1058
01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:28.984
Tcx young, maybe.

1059
01:59:29.061 --> 01:59:31.723
How about this one?

1060
01:59:33.399 --> 01:59:38.234
Better now? But incomplete.

1061
01:59:43.509 --> 01:59:46.808
Get thee behind me, Satan.

1062
01:59:46.879 --> 01:59:51.578
Wh o a re you to even th ¡ n k you ca n know
the difference between gcxxi and evil?

1063
01:59:53.686 --> 01:59:55.085
Are you Gcx?

1064
01:59:59.425 --> 02:00:02.019
I’m just a messenger.

1065
02:00:02.094 --> 02:00:03.493
He needs me.

1066
02:00:03.563 --> 02:00:07.659
How can you imagine that GcxJ,
the creator of heaven and Earth...

1067
02:00:07.733 --> 02:00:09.792
the source of all life1..

1068
02:00:09.869 --> 02:00:14.067
could possibly need you?

1069
02:00:15.308 --> 02:00:16.400
I donut know

1070
02:00:16.475 --> 02:00:19.444
You don’t think He’s big enough
to deliver His own messages?

1071
02:00:20.313 --> 02:00:22.907
What do you want from me?

1072
02:00:22.982 --> 02:00:25.314
Nothing.
I’m here to set you free.

1073
02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:30.254
<No OCR content on this page>

1074
02:00:30.323 --> 02:00:32.314
The Duke of Burgundy.

1075
02:00:44.103 --> 02:00:46.697
<No OCR content on this page>

1077
02:00:50.376 --> 02:00:54.005
<No OCR content on this page>

1078
02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:57.572
Your king?
Oh, yes, of course.

1079
02:00:57.650 --> 02:01:00.414
What’s he gonna pay me with?
Cows? Chickens?

1080
02:01:00.486 --> 02:01:03.944
I prefer gold,
and the English have plenty.

1081
02:01:05.324 --> 02:01:09.158
I wonder how much they’ll pay to have
the witch of Orléans ¡n their clutches.

1082
02:01:09.228 --> 02:01:13.892
The English are so arrogant, they can’t
accept being defeated by a peasant girl.

1083
02:01:13.966 --> 02:01:16.491
It has to have been the devil’s work.

1084
02:01:16.569 --> 02:01:19.060
Gcxi defeated the English.

1085
02:01:19.138 --> 02:01:21.606
And GOEJ allowed you to be caught?

1086
02:01:23.209 --> 02:01:24.938
Personally, I don’t believe ¡n God.

1087
02:01:25.011 --> 02:01:27.479
I don’t believe in the devil either.

1088
02:01:27.546 --> 02:01:30.481
That’s why I’m never disappointed.

1089
02:01:32.485 --> 02:01:34.146
<No OCR content on this page>

1090
02:01:51.203 --> 02:01:52.864
To payjeanne’s ransom.

1091
02:01:52.938 --> 02:01:56.169
The captains gave what they could,
as well as citizens of Orléans.

1092
02:01:56.242 --> 02:02:00.975
That’s very generous of you.
How much?

1093
02:02:01.047 --> 02:02:04.016
- Ten thousand gold crowns.
- Ten thousand?

1094
02:02:04.083 --> 02:02:05.744
That’s a lot.

1095
02:02:05.818 --> 02:02:09.845
Your Grace, I placeyou ¡n charge
of this very delicate negotiation.

1096
02:02:25.137 --> 02:02:27.662
Get yourself ready.
You’re leaving.

1097
02:02:30.776 --> 02:02:32.368
<No OCR content on this page>

1098
02:02:32.445 --> 02:02:35.539
Pierre Cauchon, bishop of Beauvais.

1099
02:02:35.614 --> 02:02:39.380
As you were captured ¡n my diocese, the
duty to conduct the trial falls un me.

1100
02:02:40.586 --> 02:02:44.283
Trial?
What trial?

1101
02:02:44.357 --> 02:02:48.054
Your tnalJeanne,
on a charge of heresy.

1102
02:02:51.063 --> 02:02:52.860
But my king—

1103
02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:56.761
Didn’t he pay my ransom?

1104
02:02:56.836 --> 02:02:59.634
It seems the English care
more atxut you than the French.

1105
02:02:59.705 --> 02:03:02.230
-The English?
-Yes.

1106
02:03:02.308 --> 02:03:04.105
They paid your ransom.

1107
02:03:04.176 --> 02:03:08.272
Tomorrow you’ll be transferred
to their great castle at Rouen.

1108
02:04:09.475 --> 02:04:13.502
Our serene and Christian king, Henry Vi,
king of England and France...

1109
02:04:13.579 --> 02:04:16.946
has placed this girl in our hands,
accused of heretical deeds...

1110
02:04:17.016 --> 02:04:19.382
to be tried ¡n a matter of faith.

1111
02:04:19.452 --> 02:04:21.750
Take the Holy Gospels ¡n your hand...

1112
02:04:21.821 --> 02:04:25.484
and swear to tell the truth regarding
anythingyou may be asked.

1113
02:04:26.892 --> 02:04:31.261
I don’t know what you will ask me. You
may ask things I won’t want to answer.

1114
02:04:31.330 --> 02:04:34.458
You will swear to tell the truth
axut everything you are asked.

1115
02:04:34.533 --> 02:04:38.936
I will willingly tell the truth
axut all Earthly things.

1116
02:04:39.004 --> 02:04:43.236
But as to my revelations,
I’ve told no one except my king...

1117
02:04:44.443 --> 02:04:47.378
Charles Vil, the one and only
king of France.

1118
02:04:49.582 --> 02:04:51.948
You must take the oath.

1119
02:04:52.017 --> 02:04:55.612
Not even a king would refuse to take
an oath ¡na matter of faith.

1120
02:04:55.688 --> 02:04:58.384
I will tellyou all
that I’m allowed to tell you.

1121
02:04:59.725 --> 02:05:01.659
But as for the rest..

1122
02:05:01.727 --> 02:05:05.094
even ¡fyou threatened
to cut off my head, I won’t tell you.

1123
02:05:10.569 --> 02:05:14.869
Begin by telling us your name, assuming
you’re allowed to tell us that much.

1124
02:05:16.675 --> 02:05:18.438
My name ¡sJeanne.

1125
02:05:19.812 --> 02:05:23.373
My little cross was taken from me.
Mayl have it back?

1126
02:05:23.449 --> 02:05:26.612
Show us a little more
ccxperation first.

1127
02:05:26.685 --> 02:05:28.846
Where were you txm?

1128
02:05:28.921 --> 02:05:31.481
In a village called Domremy.

1129
02:05:31.557 --> 02:05:33.491
How old are you?

1130
02:05:33.559 --> 02:05:35.925
Nineteen, or thereaLxuts.

1131
02:05:35.995 --> 02:05:37.895
Were you baptized?

1132
02:05:39.064 --> 02:05:41.658
-Yes.
- Recite our Lord’s Prayer.

1133
02:05:43.536 --> 02:05:47.063
Not unless you hear my confession.

1134
02:05:51.010 --> 02:05:53.308
Listen to me very carefully.

1135
02:05:53.379 --> 02:05:55.813
We are all men of faith...

1136
02:05:55.881 --> 02:06:00.341
and we shall earnestly strive for the
salvation of your bcdy and your soul...

1137
02:06:00.419 --> 02:06:05.118
¡n the name of our Church who never
closes arms to those who return to her.

1138
02:06:05.190 --> 02:06:07.215
But we cannot help you...

1139
02:06:07.293 --> 02:06:10.091
unless you submit to our
learned judgment and authority.

1140
02:06:10.162 --> 02:06:13.359
Take heed of this
charitable admonition...

1141
02:06:13.432 --> 02:06:15.559
for ¡fyou persist
¡n refusing our help...

1142
02:06:15.634 --> 02:06:20.196
we shall have no choice but to
abandon you to the secular powers.

1143
02:06:20.272 --> 02:06:23.139
And I thinkyou know well enough
the punishment that would await you.

1144
02:06:28.747 --> 02:06:30.715
Now...

1145
02:06:30.783 --> 02:06:33.809
will you please recite
our Lord’s Prayer?

1146
02:06:36.455 --> 02:06:39.117
Not unless you hear my confession.

1147
02:06:42.061 --> 02:06:46.862
Be careflul. You aren’t helping yourself
by refusing to submit to our judgment

1148
02:06:46.932 --> 02:06:48.866
<No OCR content on this page>

1149
02:06:48.934 --> 02:06:51.903
who claim to be my judges,
you becareftil!

1150
02:06:52.972 --> 02:06:55.600
Foryou t one day will be judged.

1151
02:06:55.674 --> 02:06:57.301
Guards, take the prisoner away!

1152
02:07:00.346 --> 02:07:02.507
- Silence!
— Sorceress!

1153
02:07:02.581 --> 02:07:05.948
Silence!
Clear the rm!

1154
02:07:06.018 --> 02:07:08.680
Clear the rm!

1155
02:07:10.489 --> 02:07:15.051
In future, we should conduct inquiries
privately, away from public pressure.

1156
02:07:15.127 --> 02:07:18.426
Let the English bum her if they want.
Why does it have to involve us?

1157
02:07:18.497 --> 02:07:21.830
Because it’s our duty to rt out
heresy wherever we find it.

1158
02:07:23.936 --> 02:07:25.096
Father Vincente.

1159
02:07:27.139 --> 02:07:29.437
<No OCR content on this page>

1160

<No OCR content on this page>

1161
02:07:32.111 --> 02:07:34.671
and I won’t be part of it anymore.

1162
02:07:34.747 --> 02:07:38.239
I’m willing to be her judge,
but not her executioner.

1163
02:07:38.317 --> 02:07:40.251
That’s what I’m trying to ensure.

1164
02:07:43.455 --> 02:07:49.087
The verdict comes at the end of
a trial, Cauchon. Not at the beginning.

1165
02:07:50.863 --> 02:07:53.024
I am going back to Rome...

1166
02:07:53.098 --> 02:07:56.261
to give my rert
to our Holy Father, the Pope.

1167
02:07:58.771 --> 02:08:03.299
This is ridiculous. Now I’m the one
who’s on trial and being judged.

1168
02:08:03.375 --> 02:08:05.434
-Arrest him.
-What areyou doing?

1169
02:08:05.511 --> 02:08:08.776
This is an ecclesiastical court
You’ve no right to do this.

1170
02:08:08.847 --> 02:08:11.077
This is English territory.

1171
02:08:11.150 --> 02:08:13.175
I have the right to do anything.

1172
02:08:13.252 --> 02:08:15.447
Is that clear?

1173
02:08:31.470 --> 02:08:33.131
Our Father who art ¡n heaven—

1174
02:08:33.205 --> 02:08:35.173
Thy kingdom come—

1175
02:08:40.145 --> 02:08:42.375
Forgive us—
Forgive them—

1176
02:08:42.448 --> 02:08:45.679
Forgive them, then forgive us.
Forgive them.

1177
02:08:45.751 --> 02:08:47.150
Why were you yelling?

1178
02:08:52.157 --> 02:08:55.752
What are you doing here?
You can’t stay here! Go away!

1179
02:08:55.828 --> 02:08:58.592
Why? Are you waiting for someone else?

1180
02:08:59.698 --> 02:09:00.790
<No OCR content on this page>

1181
02:09:01.533 --> 02:09:04.263
- Who?
— My visions.

1182
02:09:04.336 --> 02:09:05.928
Your visions.

1183
02:09:07.139 --> 02:09:09.130
They’re going tovisityou in here?

1184
02:09:09.208 --> 02:09:12.109
Yes. That’s what I pray for.

1185
02:09:12.911 --> 02:09:16.176
I want to see that
Doyou mind if I stayon the side here?

1186
02:09:16.248 --> 02:09:17.476
- I won’t Lxther you.
-Nol

1187
02:09:19.084 --> 02:09:20.711
No you Œn’t! You ŒflPt!

1188
02:09:20.786 --> 02:09:22.777
- Or else they won’t come.
- Why won’t they?

1189
02:09:22.855 --> 02:09:25.050
Because I have to be alone.

1190
02:09:25.124 --> 02:09:28.821
Oh. They won’t come anyway.

1191
02:09:29.728 --> 02:09:32.561
- What do you mean, they won’t come?
-Why would they?

1192
02:09:33.766 --> 02:09:36.792
Because I’ve always been faithfùl
to God...

1193
02:09:36.869 --> 02:09:38.734
and I’ve followed everything
He’s ever said...

1194
02:09:38.804 --> 02:09:40.965
and I’ve done everything
He’s everasked me to do.

1195
02:09:41.039 --> 02:09:42.836
God asked you to do something?

1196
02:09:47.179 --> 02:09:49.010
Yes, lots of things.

1197
02:09:49.081 --> 02:09:52.346
You mean, Gcxi said...

1198
02:09:52.417 --> 02:09:54.214
‘I needyou,Jeanne’?

1199
02:09:56.955 --> 02:09:59.753
But He’s sent me signs.

1200
02:10:01.527 --> 02:10:04.087
Signs? What signs?

1201
02:10:06.298 --> 02:10:08.027
The wind. The wind.

1202
02:10:12.538 --> 02:10:13.505
Wind.

1203
02:10:13.572 --> 02:10:16.564
And the clouds. Ringing.

1204
02:10:19.244 --> 02:10:20.871
Ringing cloud.

1205
02:10:21.847 --> 02:10:23.838
The dance. The dance.

1206
02:10:38.430 --> 02:10:41.399
The sword. The sword lying ¡n the field.

1207
02:10:41.466 --> 02:10:43.127
That was a sign.

1208
02:10:43.202 --> 02:10:46.638
No. That was a sword ¡n a field.

1209
02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:50.707
No. No. That was a sign.

1210
02:10:50.776 --> 02:10:53.711
No, that was a sword ¡n a field.

1211
02:10:53.779 --> 02:10:57.840
It can’t just get there by itself.
It can’t.

1212
02:10:57.916 --> 02:11:00.908
A sword just doesn’t get there
by itself.

1213
02:11:00.986 --> 02:11:05.719
True. Every event has an infinite
number of causes, so why pick one?

1214
02:11:05.791 --> 02:11:08.259
There are many ways a sword
might find itself in a field.

1215
02:11:13.465 --> 02:11:17.231
Seems a perfectly valid explanation,
but how about this one?

1216
02:11:23.275 --> 02:11:25.266
Then again, there are other
possi bi I ities.

1217
02:11:30.082 --> 02:11:31.276
Or even faster.

1218
02:11:34.853 --> 02:11:37.845
And that’s without counting
the inexplicable.

1219
02:11:40.225 --> 02:11:44.457
Yet from an infinite number of
possibilities you had to pick this one.

1220
02:11:58.176 --> 02:12:01.976
You didn’t see what was,Jeanne.

1221
02:12:02.047 --> 02:12:05.278
You saw what you wanted to see.

1222
02:12:21.566 --> 02:12:25.297
This voice that you say
appears to you...

1223
02:12:25.370 --> 02:12:29.466
¡s ¡t an angel or a saint,
or does ¡t come from God?

1224
02:12:29.541 --> 02:12:33.978
I won’t tell you any more atxut that.

1225
02:12:34.046 --> 02:12:36.537
I’m more afraid of displeasing Him
than not answering you.

1226
02:12:36.615 --> 02:12:41.484
You’re afraid of displeasing Gcxi
by telling the truth?

1227
02:12:41.553 --> 02:12:44.920
Did Gxi forbid you
to tell the truth?

1228
02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:48.926
My revelations were for
the king of France, not for you.

1229
02:12:50.996 --> 02:12:53.556
When you saw your king
for the first time...

1230
02:12:53.632 --> 02:12:56.032
was there an angel over his head?

1231
02:12:56.101 --> 02:12:57.864
If there was one, I did not see it..

1232
02:12:57.936 --> 02:13:00.905
Whydidyour king believe ¡nyou
without any prcxf?

1233
02:13:01.907 --> 02:13:03.499
Go ask him yourself.

1234
02:13:17.155 --> 02:13:18.179
Dinner.

1235
02:13:34.673 --> 02:13:37.938
When you were taken prisoner,
did you have a horse?

1236
02:13:38.010 --> 02:13:41.446
Yes. A half-steed. Black.

1237
02:13:41.513 --> 02:13:44.073
- Who gave you that horse?
- My king.

1238
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:46.549
How many did he give you?

1239
02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:51.188
Five steeds...

1240
02:13:51.256 --> 02:13:53.918
and a few hackneys.

1241
02:13:53.992 --> 02:13:57.155
As much as fora lord.
What an honor.

1242
02:13:57.229 --> 02:13:59.823
Did your king give you other wealth
apart from those horses?

1243
02:14:01.867 --> 02:14:05.234
What atxut all those dresses
you were given?

1244
02:14:05.303 --> 02:14:06.770
Silk dresses, weren’t they?

1245
02:14:07.973 --> 02:14:09.065
<No OCR content on this page>

1246
02:14:09.141 --> 02:14:11.735
Yes, I was given a few.

1247
02:14:11.810 --> 02:14:15.576
But I never had time to wear them.

1248
02:14:15.647 --> 02:14:19.139
Still, pretty wealthy
for a peasant girl, wouldn’t you say?

1249
02:14:21.653 --> 02:14:25.680
You kxk pretty wealthy
fora servant of God, wouldn’t you say?

1250
02:14:31.129 --> 02:14:33.324
<No OCR content on this page>

1251
02:14:33.398 --> 02:14:35.423
Itriedto.

1252
02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:37.661
And didn’t you order the citizens
of Pans to surrender the city...

1253
02:14:37.736 --> 02:14:39.101
¡n the name of the King of Heaven?

1254
02:14:39.171 --> 02:14:43.369
No. I said, Surrender ¡n the name
of the king of France.

1255
02:14:43.442 --> 02:14:46.036
<No OCR content on this page>

1256
02:14:47.712 --> 02:14:49.111
Lcx,k yourself.

1257
02:14:49.181 --> 02:14:52.378
I can’t read.

1258
02:14:53.985 --> 02:14:56.476
Yes, I forgot

1259
02:14:56.555 --> 02:15:00.616
Gcxi sent us an illiterate peasant
to carry out such an important mission.

1260
02:15:00.692 --> 02:15:02.853
<No OCR content on this page>

1261
02:15:02.928 --> 02:15:07.422
To take an ignorant girl
to save the kingdom of France?

1262
02:15:07.499 --> 02:15:09.160
I leave that answer to God.

1263
02:15:13.939 --> 02:15:15.668
Fuck!

1264
02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:17.731
Calm down, my lord.
I begyou.

1265
02:15:17.809 --> 02:15:20.869
Howcanlwhenl’m made
the laughingstock of the whole court?

1266
02:15:20.946 --> 02:15:23.312
You’ve seen how ¡t ¡s.
This girl has a way with people...

1267
02:15:23.381 --> 02:15:25.542
but we’re making progress every day.

1268
02:15:25.617 --> 02:15:29.576
As long as that bitch remains alive,
our armies refuse to fight. Understand?

1269
02:15:29.654 --> 02:15:31.451
They
that God
need pRxf
¡s on their side.

1270
02:15:31.523 --> 02:15:34.321
It’s not for us to bum her.
That’s your prerogative.

1271
02:15:34.392 --> 02:15:36.189
And it’s your prerogative
to find herguilty!

1272
02:15:36.261 --> 02:15:39.526
But we can’t do that
unless she admits to blasphemy.

1273
02:15:39.598 --> 02:15:41.122
What are you waiting for?

1274
02:15:41.199 --> 02:15:44.498
You’ve got a castle ful of racks,
ropes and pulleys. Torture the bitch!

1275
02:15:44.569 --> 02:15:47.470
You’ll never get anything
out of her that way.

1276
02:15:47.539 --> 02:15:50.303
And besides...

1277
02:15:50.375 --> 02:15:55.540
you must realize that several
of my colleagues are, well, scared.

1278
02:15:55.614 --> 02:15:58.378
Scared? Of a girl?

1279
02:15:58.450 --> 02:16:01.078
Scared to make a mistake.

1280
02:16:01.153 --> 02:16:03.383
Supxse she’s right.

1281
02:16:03.455 --> 02:16:05.923
Supxse she has been sent by God

1282
02:16:10.395 --> 02:16:15.128
- Who’s side are you on, Cauchon?
- I’m on the side of Holy Mother Church.

1283
02:16:16.168 --> 02:16:18.261
Do you have a sword?

1284
02:16:19.738 --> 02:16:21.899
- Quite a few.
- Didn’t you also carry a banner?

1285
02:16:23.441 --> 02:16:24.465
<No OCR content on this page>

1286
02:16:24.543 --> 02:16:27.774
Which do you prefer?
Your banner oryour sword?

1287
02:16:27.846 --> 02:16:30.371
I was 40 times more fond of my banner.

1288
02:16:30.448 --> 02:16:33.383
Why? Did ithavesome
particular value or power?

1289
02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:38.345
It’s just—

1290
02:16:38.423 --> 02:16:41.221
-Asword ¡saweaíxn.
-And?

1291
02:16:42.327 --> 02:16:46.491
And so, I prefer my banner.

1292
02:16:46.565 --> 02:16:47.691
Why?

1293
02:16:47.766 --> 02:16:50.735
To avoid killing anyone.

1294
02:16:50.802 --> 02:16:53.896
Are you saying ¡f you’d not
been carrying your banner...

1295
02:16:53.972 --> 02:16:55.496
<No OCR content on this page>

1296
02:16:59.811 --> 02:17:01.779
Of course not.
I never killed anyone.

1297
02:17:01.846 --> 02:17:04.610
Then perhaps the temptation...

1298
02:17:04.683 --> 02:17:06.776
to kill would have been stronger—

1299
02:17:06.851 --> 02:17:08.751
t strong, perhaps.

1300
02:17:10.288 --> 02:17:12.313
I warned the English to go back home.

1301
02:17:12.390 --> 02:17:14.915
<No OCR content on this page>

1302
02:17:14.993 --> 02:17:17.461
We have numerous witnesses
who can confirm...

1303
02:17:17.529 --> 02:17:19.520
you were not always
carrying your banner.

1304
02:17:23.735 --> 02:17:25.464
Yes, perhaps.

1305
02:17:25.537 --> 02:17:27.801
Sometimes you were carrying
just your sword.

1306
02:17:29.541 --> 02:17:31.372
<No OCR content on this page>

1307
02:17:31.443 --> 02:17:33.570
Did you use the sword
you held in your hand?

1308
02:17:33.645 --> 02:17:35.806
Yes, I used ¡t—
I held itup—

1309
02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:39.281
You held up your sword
and flourished ¡t about like this!

1310
02:17:39.351 --> 02:17:40.375
I don’t remember.

1311
02:17:40.452 --> 02:17:43.421
So, you were on the battlefield
with your sword in your hand...

1312
02:17:43.488 --> 02:17:46.514
waving it alxwe your head,
charging against the enemy...

1313
02:17:46.591 --> 02:17:49.059
screaming at the enemy,
fighting for vur life..

1314
02:17:49.127 --> 02:17:50.924
and you expect us to believe...

1315
02:17:50.996 --> 02:17:54.523
that in the middle
ofall this excitement...

1316
02:17:54.599 --> 02:17:58.865
you never killed anyone.

1317
02:17:58.937 --> 02:18:02.395
No. I neyer killed anyone.

1318
02:18:04.442 --> 02:18:06.137
I can’t believe
you can lie like that.

1319
02:18:06.211 --> 02:18:09.476
Im not lying. I’m not lying.
Leave me alone. I can’t remember.

1320
02:18:09.547 --> 02:18:12.744
-I didn’t kill anyone. I can’t remember.
-Let me help your memory.

1321
02:18:13.385 --> 02:18:16.149
I don’t want to hear any more.
Leave me alone. I didn’t kill that man.

1322
02:18:16.221 --> 02:18:17.654
Leave me alone!

1323
02:18:17.722 --> 02:18:20.589
Stop. Stop. I can’t remember.

1324
02:18:20.659 --> 02:18:24.925
The battles were so confusing. I was
only defending myself as best I could.

1325
02:18:24.996 --> 02:18:29.023
There was so much dust, smoke and noise.
I was being attacked on all sides.

1326
02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:31.898
So maybe perhaps I fought badc

1327
02:18:31.970 --> 02:18:34.996
- But ¡t was only to defend myself.
- So your memory’s coming back.

1328
02:18:35.073 --> 02:18:37.041
-Yes.
- GTJi1.

1329
02:18:37.108 --> 02:18:41.340
Now, you tell me why Gcxi let all those
battles happen ¡n the first place.

1330
02:18:41.413 --> 02:18:42.971
He’s so powerful. You said...

1331
02:18:43.048 --> 02:18:45.346
He’s the creator of heaven and Earth,
the source of all Iife.

1332
02:18:45.417 --> 02:18:48.682
He could easily have stopped
all that bkxxi and misery.

1333
02:18:48.753 --> 02:18:49.720
Why didn’t He—

1334
02:18:49.788 --> 02:18:52.780
Is He the one who spread
all that blcxxi and misery?

1335
02:18:52.857 --> 02:18:55.018
-Is He?
- No. But He could have stopped it.

1336
02:18:55.093 --> 02:18:57.891
What, did he get pleasure—
pleasure—

1337
02:18:57.962 --> 02:19:01.591
pleasure from watching us killing
each other in His name?

1338
02:19:01.666 --> 02:19:04.157
In His name?

1339
02:19:04.235 --> 02:19:07.500
In His name. We fought and killed
in His name--

1340
02:19:07.572 --> 02:19:09.699
- the King of Heaven.
- Really?

1341
02:19:09.774 --> 02:19:12.402
Let all those who love me
flollow me!

1342
02:19:12.477 --> 02:19:15.105
Let all who love me
follow mei

1343
02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:17.740
Where does GcxJ get mentioned?

1344
02:19:17.816 --> 02:19:20.216
Come on,Jeanne.

1345
02:19:20.285 --> 02:19:22.082
Be honest.

1346
02:19:22.153 --> 02:19:24.986
You fought for yourself.
In your name.

1347
02:19:25.056 --> 02:19:27.115
No!

1348
02:19:27.192 --> 02:19:29.558
I was defending myself
as best as I could.

1349
02:19:29.627 --> 02:19:32.425
Everyone has the right
to defend themselves, don’t they?

1350
02:19:32.497 --> 02:19:34.863
Yes, they do!
Should I have let myself get killed?

1351
02:19:34.933 --> 02:19:36.560
— Is that it?
- No. You did fine.

1352
02:19:36.634 --> 02:19:38.602
I’d even say well done.

1353
02:19:38.670 --> 02:19:40.865
As a matter of fact..

1354
02:19:40.939 --> 02:19:44.102
most of the ones you killed
probably deserved ¡t, don’tyou think?

1355
02:19:47.645 --> 02:19:50.478
I neyer thought killing each other
would bring alxut any ace.

1356
02:19:50.548 --> 02:19:51.446
I agree.

1357
02:19:51.516 --> 02:19:54.007
Peace will only be got from
the English at the end of a lance.

1358
02:19:54.085 --> 02:19:57.179
I don’t agree. Why do you keep
changing your mind all the time?

1359
02:19:58.923 --> 02:20:01.084
You. Why—

1360
02:20:01.159 --> 02:20:03.787
Why areyou doing this to me?

1361
02:20:03.862 --> 02:20:06.023
Do you get pleasure from hurting me?

1362
02:20:06.097 --> 02:20:09.999
Pleasure.
That’s a difficult word to define.

1363
02:20:11.770 --> 02:20:16.002
When does pain end and pleasure begin?
When did your pleasure begin?

1364
02:20:16.074 --> 02:20:20.272
With that sword in your hand?

1365
02:20:21.546 --> 02:20:24.743
I neyer txk pleasure...

1366
02:20:24.816 --> 02:20:27.284
¡n hurting anyone.

1367
02:20:28.319 --> 02:20:29.809
Really?

1368
02:20:54.913 --> 02:20:58.713
Set me free. Set me free.

1369
02:20:58.783 --> 02:21:00.410
You will be,Jeanne.

1370
02:21:01.553 --> 02:21:03.487
<No OCR content on this page>

1371
02:21:24.676 --> 02:21:27.201
Jeanne, myvery dear
friend ¡n ChnsL.

1372
02:21:27.278 --> 02:21:29.212
we, your judges and assessors...

1373
02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:31.874
desirous of reaching
a true and lawful verdict..

1374
02:21:31.950 --> 02:21:35.351
submitted a transcript of your trial
to the University of Pans...

1375
02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:36.682
to attain their opinion.

1376
02:21:36.754 --> 02:21:39.222
After careful consideration...

1377
02:21:39.290 --> 02:21:41.315
the learned scholars
have concluded with us...

1378
02:21:41.392 --> 02:21:45.021
that you have committed
many grievous sins.

1379
02:21:45.096 --> 02:21:47.587
I ask you now
to listen most carefully...

1380
02:21:47.665 --> 02:21:50.600
to their opinion,
as detailed in these articles.

1381
02:21:53.471 --> 02:21:55.132
Article One.

1382
02:21:55.206 --> 02:21:59.370
You said that by GcxJ’s command you have
continually worn men’s clothes...

1383
02:21:59.444 --> 02:22:01.742
and that you have also worn
your hair short..

1384
02:22:01.813 --> 02:22:04.976
with nothing to distinguish you from
the soldiers with whom you fought

1385
02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:11.350
Don’t abandon me. Please.

1386
02:22:13.424 --> 02:22:16.587
Where are You?

1387
02:22:16.661 --> 02:22:18.686
Where are You? Please.

1388
02:22:22.734 --> 02:22:25.862
Is this what You want?

1389
02:22:27.305 --> 02:22:30.001
You want me to...

1390
02:22:30.074 --> 02:22:32.474
<No OCR content on this page>

1391
02:22:32.544 --> 02:22:34.535
Wi thouL

1392
02:22:34.612 --> 02:22:37.172
being confessed?

1393
02:22:37.248 --> 02:22:40.308
Finally, Article 12.

1394
02:22:40.385 --> 02:22:42.751
You have said that you are not
willing to submit yourself...

1395
02:22:42.820 --> 02:22:46.415
to the judgment of the church militant,
but only to GcxJ.

1396
02:22:46.491 --> 02:22:48.425
As to this article,
the scholars say...

1397
02:22:48.493 --> 02:22:51.257
that you have no comprehension
of the authority of the Church.

1398
02:22:51.329 --> 02:22:54.355
That you have perniciously erred
in the faith of God...

1399
02:22:54.432 --> 02:22:58.095
and you are a child of superstition,
a wanderer from the faith...

1400
02:22:58.169 --> 02:23:01.661
an invoker of demons, an idolater...

1401
02:23:01.739 --> 02:23:03.673
and a heretic.

1402
02:23:14.686 --> 02:23:18.247
We once again admonish,
beg and exalt you...

1403
02:23:18.323 --> 02:23:21.884
to cast out and recant
your erroneous beliefs...

1404
02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:24.986
by signing this recantation.

1405
02:23:26.130 --> 02:23:27.119
Please.

1406
02:23:28.866 --> 02:23:30.891
<No OCR content on this page>

1407
02:23:30.969 --> 02:23:34.234
wants me to say...

1408
02:23:34.305 --> 02:23:36.705
that my visions are evil...

1409
02:23:36.774 --> 02:23:39.709
then I do not believe ¡n this Church.

1410
02:23:44.882 --> 02:23:46.144
Perform your office.

1411
02:23:52.290 --> 02:23:53.723
Wait.

1412
02:23:57.662 --> 02:24:00.961
Jeanne, I beg of you, sign.

1413
02:24:01.032 --> 02:24:04.092
In GcxJ’s name, don’t you understand?
I’m trying to save you.

1414
02:24:04.168 --> 02:24:06.659
I want to be confessed.

1415
02:24:08.006 --> 02:24:10.406
<No OCR content on this page>

1416
02:24:10.475 --> 02:24:15.139
And may I—

1417
02:24:15.213 --> 02:24:18.114
May I go to Mass?

1418
02:24:18.182 --> 02:24:20.241
As often as you like.

1419
02:24:20.318 --> 02:24:23.082
Now, for the love of GcxJ, sign.

1420
02:24:28.426 --> 02:24:31.657
Sign J eanne,
and you’ll be free of your chains.

1421
02:24:31.729 --> 02:24:34.129
Free of the firejeanne.

1422
02:25:09.067 --> 02:25:10.728
Thankyou.

1423
02:25:14.305 --> 02:25:17.399
Do you know what you just signed?

1424
02:25:17.475 --> 02:25:20.103
<No OCR content on this page>

1425
02:25:21.612 --> 02:25:26.015
-l didn’t
- Foryou,
mean to.
He’s a lie.

1426
02:25:27.819 --> 02:25:29.810
An illusion.

1427
02:25:29.887 --> 02:25:32.082
No,na.

1428
02:25:32.156 --> 02:25:34.351
He told me that I would be confessed.

1429
02:25:35.259 --> 02:25:38.353
In the end, ¡t was you
who abandoned Him.

1430
02:25:45.436 --> 02:25:47.927
- May I have that back, please?
-You have nothing to regret.

1431
02:25:50.274 --> 02:25:52.834
Give ¡t back to me!

1432
02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:56.141
- Give it back!
- Take her away!

1433
02:26:00.852 --> 02:26:02.479
Silence her!

1434
02:26:07.358 --> 02:26:09.519
There. She has recanted.

1435
02:26:09.594 --> 02:26:11.960
And we accept her repentance...

1436
02:26:12.029 --> 02:26:15.487
for the Church never closes her arms
to those who would return to the fold.

1437
02:26:17.235 --> 02:26:21.433
Now she’s your martyr, not ours.

1438
02:26:47.732 --> 02:26:49.563
Please!

1439
02:26:56.073 --> 02:26:58.405
Enough.

1440
02:27:04.448 --> 02:27:06.541
Here.

1441
02:27:06.617 --> 02:27:10.417
Ifyou want to get dressed,
try these for size.

1442
02:27:16.661 --> 02:27:19.129
My lord bishop.

1443
02:27:28.873 --> 02:27:30.807
Come to see for yourself.

1444
02:27:30.875 --> 02:27:33.139
Well, take a look.

1445
02:27:38.282 --> 02:27:40.773
You see?
Dressed as a man again.

1446
02:27:40.852 --> 02:27:43.150
Her touching repentance
didn’t last very long, did it?

1447
02:27:44.722 --> 02:27:49.489
The Bishop of Senlis was passing by
and was on hand to witness her relapse.

1448
02:27:51.963 --> 02:27:55.057
And by what miracle did these clothes
find their way in here?

1449
02:27:55.132 --> 02:27:57.259
Nota miracle, mydearCauchon.

1450
02:27:57.335 --> 02:27:59.599
An evil spell.

1451
02:27:59.670 --> 02:28:03.003
This girl is a witch,
and tomorrow she will bum r it.

1452
02:28:04.942 --> 02:28:07.706
Have the stake prepared
¡n the marketplace.

1453
02:28:22.727 --> 02:28:26.629
Jeanne, I don’t understand.
Why did you do ¡t?

1454
02:28:26.697 --> 02:28:28.494
-Why?
- And you.

1455
02:28:28.566 --> 02:28:30.761
Why did you lie?

1456
02:28:30.835 --> 02:28:32.632
You promised to have me confessed.

1457
02:28:32.703 --> 02:28:35.604
I know. It was the onlyway
to have you saved from the fire.

1458
02:28:35.673 --> 02:28:38.972
It’s not my body I want to save.

1459
02:28:39.043 --> 02:28:40.704
It’s my soul.

1460
02:28:42.346 --> 02:28:45.076
I ask only one thing.

1461
02:28:45.149 --> 02:28:48.880
Please, hear my confession.

1462
02:28:52.590 --> 02:28:56.424
I can’tJeanne.
I can’t hearyour confession.

1463
02:28:59.764 --> 02:29:01.698
I’m very sorry.

1464
02:29:22.687 --> 02:29:24.587
You want to confess?

1465
02:29:28.592 --> 02:29:31.083
I’m listening.

1466
02:29:31.162 --> 02:29:33.460
I’ve committed sins, my Lord.

1467
02:29:36.667 --> 02:29:38.567
So many sins.

1468
02:29:42.039 --> 02:29:45.873
I saw so many signs.

1469
02:29:45.943 --> 02:29:48.002
Many signs.

1470
02:29:49.947 --> 02:29:52.177
The ones I wanted to see.

1471
02:29:58.055 --> 02:30:00.523
I fought..

1472
02:30:03.728 --> 02:30:05.662
out of revenge...

1473
02:30:08.599 --> 02:30:10.533
and despair.

1474
02:30:17.708 --> 02:30:20.575
<No OCR content on this page>

1475
02:30:20.644 --> 02:30:24.603
that people believe...

1476
02:30:24.682 --> 02:30:26.843
they’re allowed to be.

1477
02:30:26.917 --> 02:30:30.011
when they’re fighting for...

1478
02:30:33.724 --> 02:30:35.248
a cause.

1479
02:30:36.327 --> 02:30:37.658
Fora cause.

1480
02:30:39.997 --> 02:30:41.589
I was...

1481
02:30:44.001 --> 02:30:45.628
proud...

1482
02:30:47.338 --> 02:30:48.930
and...

1483
02:30:51.942 --> 02:30:53.409
<No OCR content on this page>

1484
02:30:53.477 --> 02:30:55.069
Selfish.

1485
02:30:56.414 --> 02:30:58.075
Selfish.

1486
02:30:58.149 --> 02:31:00.811
Yes. Cruel.

1487
02:31:03.921 --> 02:31:05.548
<No OCR content on this page>

1488
02:31:05.623 --> 02:31:07.523
Cruel.

1489
02:31:09.660 --> 02:31:12.424
You thinkyou are ready now?

1490
02:31:16.700 --> 02:31:18.031
<No OCR content on this page>

1491
02:31:19.937 --> 02:31:21.734
Good.
