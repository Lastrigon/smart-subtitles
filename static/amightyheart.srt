1
00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:01.029
Take care of her.

2
00:17:47.699 --> 00:17:51.100
Driver, please stop near
the Hotel Akbar International.

3
00:19:24.463 --> 00:19:27.193
Look through all the papers in here
and put them over there.

4
00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:28.596
Is this your house?

5
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.600
-Yes, it’s my house.
-Your name?

6
00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:33.734
Have you got any ID?

7
00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:36.034
Yes, I have my passporl.

8
00:19:37.976 --> 00:19:38.965
I’m from India.

9
00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.288
Look under the bed.

10
00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:07.338
Give those pictures to me.

11
00:21:36.928 --> 00:21:39.055
Did you get the taxi for Daniel Pearl?

12
00:21:39.164 --> 00:21:41.496
-Yes, sir.
-Where did you get the taxi from?

13
00:21:42.234 --> 00:21:44.429
Sir, from Two Swords.

14
00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:47.631
Get out.

15
00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:50.974
What’s your name?

16
00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:55.170
Hello, son.

17
00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:56.474
What’s your name?

18
00:22:15.801 --> 00:22:17.996
-You didn’t see anyone at 7 pm?
-No.

19
00:22:18.103 --> 00:22:20.128
There was no foreigner here yesterday?

20
00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:27.810
Yesterday evening,
did you see a foreigner here?

21
00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:29.436
No, sir.

22
00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.628
Hello, Paracha, this is Masud.

23
00:25:00.298 --> 00:25:03.267
He had short hair, skinny
and was wearing glasses.

24
00:25:03.368 --> 00:25:06.201
We found one person.

25
00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:18.577
-What is your name?
-Aqeel Nawaz.

26
00:25:34.499 --> 00:25:38.560
We’ve brought you something.
It was the best we could find in Karachi.

27
00:26:07.566 --> 00:26:09.500
If you need anything, don’t hesitate.

28
00:26:10.168 --> 00:26:11.931
Goodbye, Mariane, be brave.

29
00:28:54.265 --> 00:28:56.460
Come on, get them in the car.

30
00:28:56.568 --> 00:28:57.660
Go on, move it.

31
00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:59.669
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

32
00:28:59.771 --> 00:29:01.568
We’re conducting
a proper investigation.

33
00:29:05.944 --> 00:29:07.502
How long have you been here?

34
00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:08.977
One year, sir.

35
00:29:09.681 --> 00:29:11.148
How many children do you have?

36
00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:12.238
Sir, only one child.

37
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.147
-Only one?
-Yes.

38
00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:31.362
The ISI came to my parents and asked,
where did this girl come from?

39
00:29:31.469 --> 00:29:32.834
From India?

40
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.873
I know that but...

41
00:30:27.358 --> 00:30:28.848
Connect those lines.

42
00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:08.324
How many lines are you getting us?

43
00:31:08.433 --> 00:31:09.457
Six lines.

44
00:31:09.567 --> 00:31:10.727
Where are they coming from?

45
00:31:10.835 --> 00:31:12.234
We’re cutting off
the neighbors’ phone lines.

46
00:31:12.337 --> 00:31:13.326
What will happen to their phones?

47
00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:15.338
They’ll have to use yours.

48
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:48.064
Check everybody’s ID
before you let them through.

49
00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.942
Have you seen this person?

50
00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:48.614
I’m looking for somebody who
stayed here called Chaudhry Bashir.

51
00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:49.845
Here is his number.

52
00:39:58.729 --> 00:40:01.197
How long do we have to stay here?

53
00:40:01.298 --> 00:40:02.731
Until we find him.

54
00:43:12.456 --> 00:43:14.651
Okay, we’re on our way.

55
00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:17.659
Masud, where’s the coach station
for Muzaffarabad?

56
00:43:17.761 --> 00:43:18.955
Is Arif going to Muzaffarabad?

57
00:43:19.063 --> 00:43:20.860
From Pirwadhi Bus Station?

58
00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:33.037
Is Arif here?

59
00:44:36.373 --> 00:44:38.398
Where is Hashim’s house?

60
00:44:40.844 --> 00:44:42.436
Where is Hashim’s house?

61
00:44:47.618 --> 00:44:49.210
Where is Hashim?

62
00:44:49.319 --> 00:44:50.616
We want to search the house.

63
00:44:50.721 --> 00:44:51.779
Why are you all coming in here?

64
00:47:02.986 --> 00:47:04.214
Come on, help us push.

65
00:53:32.976 --> 00:53:34.705
What do you think of this, Shabir?

66
00:59:52.717 --> 00:59:54.116
What’s your name?

67
00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:57.482
Is this computer yours?

68
00:59:57.588 --> 01:00:00.421
-This computer is mine.
-Turn it on, please.

69
01:00:00.825 --> 01:00:04.352
It can’t be switched on
because the hard disk has crashed.

70
01:00:04.462 --> 01:00:05.827
What happened to the hard disk?

71
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:07.625
There was a virus on it and it crashed.

72
01:00:07.732 --> 01:00:09.700
I took jito repair two days ago.

73
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.893
-It broke down two days ago?
-Yes.

74
01:00:12.003 --> 01:00:12.992
Okay.

75
01:00:16.207 --> 01:00:17.196
Take him in.

76
01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:21.301
How many computers
have you connected in that building?

77
01:00:22.179 --> 01:00:23.874
In that building, twenty or more.

78
01:00:23.981 --> 01:00:25.380
-Twenty?
-Yes.

79
01:00:25.483 --> 01:00:26.677
Is this your job?

80
01:00:27.151 --> 01:00:28.550
Yes, this is what I do.

81
01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:32.246
We are looking
for Daniel Pearl’s photograph.

82
01:00:34.592 --> 01:00:36.583
We have new software

83
01:00:36.694 --> 01:00:39.686
that can recover deleted files
from your hard drive

84
01:00:39.797 --> 01:00:41.560
just like that.

85
01:00:43.501 --> 01:00:47.096
Whatever you know, just tell us now.
You won’t have any difficulties.

86
01:00:47.204 --> 01:00:49.229
If the Americans find out,
you’ll be in big trouble

87
01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:50.602
and we won’t be able to help you.

88
01:00:50.975 --> 01:00:53.375
There was no-one else?
You did it on your own?

89
01:00:53.477 --> 01:00:55.843
No, sir,
my cousin Suleiman was with me.

90
01:00:56.313 --> 01:00:57.644
-Okay, he’s your cousin?
-Yes.

91
01:00:57.748 --> 01:00:58.976
Where does he live?

92
01:00:59.083 --> 01:01:00.607
-He lives in Karachi.
-Is he in Karachi now?

93
01:01:00.718 --> 01:01:02.447
-Yes.
-Come on, let’s go.

94
01:01:02.553 --> 01:01:03.542
Well done.

95
01:01:10.795 --> 01:01:11.853
Quickly, quickly.

96
01:01:19.503 --> 01:01:20.527
This is the place.

97
01:01:30.614 --> 01:01:31.911
There he is.

98
01:01:33.918 --> 01:01:35.681
That’s him.

99
01:01:37.688 --> 01:01:39.280
Yes, he’s the one.

100
01:01:54.738 --> 01:01:55.830
Come on, move it.

101
01:02:02.947 --> 01:02:04.505
Get out of the way.

102
01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:31.530
Give me his phone.

103
01:02:34.979 --> 01:02:36.844
Tell him what I told you to say.

104
01:02:42.052 --> 01:02:43.041
It’s Suleiman.

105
01:02:48.325 --> 01:02:50.816
-He says he’s not there.
-Do you have his cell number?

106
01:02:50.928 --> 01:02:52.896
-Yes.
-Then let’s try it.

107
01:02:53.464 --> 01:02:54.522
Be quiet.

108
01:02:57.301 --> 01:02:58.598
Suleiman speaking.

109
01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:02.300
-What do you want?
-I need to speak to you.

110
01:03:02.406 --> 01:03:05.341
I need to meet you urgently.

111
01:03:05.442 --> 01:03:09.105
Not now. We’ll meet up early
tomorrow morning and talk. Okay?

112
01:03:13.384 --> 113
01:03:15.019 --> 01:03:15.280
Sir, he’s saying we’ll speak tomorrow.

114
01:03:15.386 --> 01:03:17.081
Take down this number.

115
01:03:18.322 --> 01:03:19.311
Open the door.

116
01:03:19.957 --> 01:03:21.982
Sir, this is the phone company.

117
01:03:37.942 --> 01:03:40.206
We don’t have any time, you bastard.

118
01:03:59.096 --> 01:04:00.688
We need to trace a number.

119
01:04:01.365 --> 01:04:04.630
Sorry, sir, the office is closed, we can’t
give you any information right now.

120
01:04:04.735 --> 01:04:07.226
What do you need
to do with this number?

121
01:04:07.338 --> 01:04:09.533
I am CID Chief Javed Habib.

122
01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:11.164
You know what I can do?

123
01:04:11.275 --> 01:04:13.300
Screw your confidentiality,
I need that information.

124
01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:15.139
A man has been kidnapped, a foreigner.

125
01:04:15.246 --> 01:04:17.237
If something happens to him,
Pakistan will have a bad reputation.

126
01:04:55.819 --> 01:04:57.309
-Who’s there?
-Don’t move.

127
01:04:59.056 --> 01:05:01.024
-Put your hands up.
-Take him away.

128
01:05:01.125 --> 01:05:02.217
You’ll be sorry.

129
01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:04.052
God is great.

130
01:05:05.129 --> 01:05:06.153
God is great.

131
01:05:24.381 --> 01:05:25.370
Where is Daniel Pearl?

132
01:05:26.684 --> 01:05:27.673
I don’t know.

133
01:05:28.319 --> 01:05:29.308
What do you know?

134
01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:31.209
I don’t know anything.

135
01:05:34.325 --> 01:05:36.088
Tell me whatever you know.

136
01:05:41.098 --> 01:05:42.656
I don’t know anything.

137
01:05:46.003 --> 01:05:46.992
What do you know?

138
01:05:54.411 --> 01:05:55.400
What do you know?

139
01:05:55.879 --> 01:05:56.868
Just tell me.

140
01:05:58.215 --> 01:05:59.409
What do you know?

141
01:06:00.684 --> 01:06:01.742
What did you do?

142
01:06:02.386 --> 01:06:03.375
I don’t know anything.

143
01:06:03.487 --> 01:06:05.512
-What do you know?
-Nothing.

144
01:06:11.929 --> 01:06:13.988
-What do you know?
-Nothing.

145
01:06:18.669 --> 01:06:20.102
Who asked you to e-mail?

146
01:06:26.810 --> 01:06:27.902
Who are you working for?

147
01:06:28.779 --> 01:06:29.939
Who asked you to e-mail?

148
01:06:30.748 --> 01:06:32.340
Sheikh Omar.

149
01:07:32.409 --> 01:07:33.398
Quickly, come on.

150
01:07:39.283 --> 01:07:40.511
Check all the rooms.

151
01:07:41.752 --> 01:07:43.413
Search everything.

152
01:07:45.222 --> 01:07:46.416
Who are you people?

153
01:07:46.523 --> 01:07:48.787
Is this the way to come into
respectable people’s homes?

154
01:07:49.626 --> 01:07:50.888
Where’s Sheikh Omar?

155
01:07:50.994 --> 01:07:52.518
You must have a contact number.

156
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.331
Where is Sheikh Omar?

157
01:07:58.435 --> 01:08:00.528
-We don’t know anything.
-Give me Adil’s phone.

158
01:08:01.738 --> 01:08:02.932
Give me Adil’s phone.

159
01:08:23.594 --> 01:08:24.583
Omar Sheikh?

160
01:08:25.996 --> 01:08:26.985
Yes?

161
01:08:27.564 --> 01:08:29.725
It’s Javed Habib speaking,
Omar Sheikh.

162
01:08:30.434 --> 01:08:33.665
We have all the information,
we know everything about you.

163
01:08:34.438 --> 01:08:37.669
Farhad, Adil, Suleiman,
we have all of them.

164
01:08:37.774 --> 01:08:39.241
Check your caller ID.

165
01:09:03.333 --> 01:09:05.028
Come on, bring them out.

166
01:19:03.733 --> 01:19:05.257
As far as I know

167
01:19:06.836 --> 01:19:08.133
he is not alive.

168
01:19:09.205 --> 01:19:12.038
On February 5th,
I spoke to my brothers on the phone

169
01:19:12.175 --> 01:19:15.076
and I told them
to take the patient to the doctor’s.

170
01:19:15.712 --> 01:19:18.476
This was a code to release the hostage.

171
01:23:02.905 --> 01:23:07.365
I would let you speak to her,
but she doesn’t speak Urdu.

172
01:23:09.011 --> 01:23:10.000
Okay?

173
01:31:56.305 --> 01:31:57.602
I’m here, Mariane.

174
01:33:34.103 --> 01:33:35.764
Have you no decency?

175
01:34:25.821 --> 01:34:27.288
It’s crazy, they’re everywhere.

176
01:38:19.321 --> 01:38:20.515
Oh, my daughter.

177
01:38:20.856 --> 01:38:22.289
You are so beautiful.

178
01:38:32.501 --> 01:38:35.937
The aim of Buddhism
is to draw out all the strength,

179
01:38:36.038 --> 01:38:39.201
courage, wisdom and goodwill.
