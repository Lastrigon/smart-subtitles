Lok-lam Law, Fong Bow, Eddy Ko

00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,271
Director: Ronny Yu

6
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,476
It was in the Shun Chi years
of the Ching Dynasty.

7
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,189
Emperor Shin Tsu had fallen ill,
and his life was in grave danger.

8
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,992
Legend has it that a strange rose,
which blossoms once every 20 years,

9
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,073
has the ability to revive
those that are dying.

10
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,354
The Court decided to send an envoy to
Mount Shin Fung in search of the flower.

11
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,438
Mount Shin Fung

12
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,993
I am Chief Yeh Li Nieh Tang
of the Royal Ching Palace.

13
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,311
I have come especially
to call on Master Cho of Wu Tang.

14
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,798
His Majesty's health is ailing.

15
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,309
We have long heard that
Master Cho guards a majestic flower

16
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,112
that has the power
to bring back even the dead.

17
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,598
What is the time now?

18
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,150
Oh, we are still four hours
away from blossom.

19
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,712
No, what year are we in?

20
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,352
Master, we are exactly 1 0 years
from the founding of the Ching Empire.

21
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,076
1 0 years!

22
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,996
You may all go now.

23
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,316
Master, if only your majestic flower
could restore His Majesty's health,

24
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,670
the palace will reward you handsomely.

25
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,433
This flower is not for you!

26
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,915
Cho Yi Hang,
did you hear what the Chief just said?

27
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,676
Who could be more important
than His Majesty?

28
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,070
The person in my heart is a woman.

29
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,752
I have waited here for her for a decade.

30
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,237
I wonder if she knows...

31
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,072
THE BRlDE WlTH WHlTE HAlR

32
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,796
I was the student of
Master Tzu Yang of Wu Tang.

33
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,872
He was the Joint Chief of the
Eight Big Clans of Chung Yuan, our land.

34
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,556
He was tireless in explaining to me
the misgivings of our world

35
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,353
and the differences
between good and evil.

36
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,589
Needless to say, in his words, with
the exception of the Eight Big Clans,

37
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,035
all other clans are evil.

38
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,791
Yi Hang, you must remember...

39
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,436
Good and evil are like oil and water,
they will never mix.

40
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,510
Yes, Master.

41
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,354
He'd always say the same thing,
I'd always answer the same way.

42
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,510
Have you mastered the Dragon Moon
Breaking Sword steps I taught you?

43
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,109
Yes, Master, to perfection.

44
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,155
Yi Hang!

45
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,356
Concentrate, heart and sword in one.

46
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,796
Draw!

47
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,793
The sword protects the body
even from falling petals.

48
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,554
Heart-piercing precision in one stroke!

49
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,797
Master, since I'm doing so well,

50
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,996
may I take it easy
for the next eight to ten days?

51
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,278
There is no end to learning.

52
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,472
If you want to become Joint Chief,
you will have to keep practicing.

53
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,995
Actually, I never really thought about
becoming the Joint Chief.

54
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,509
But every now and then,
I would do some good deeds.

55
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,315
If I had known,
I would have let those bad men take you.

56
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,109
Because of you,
I don't even know where I am now.

57
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,748
Master will be so upset with me.

58
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,836
There were two things in this world
that I was most scared of.

59
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,834
One was thunder and lightning.
And the other...

60
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,359
Little lamb,
now is your chance to repay me.

61
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,599
I'm leaving now. You take care.

62
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,075
Help! Help!

63
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,479
Help! Master, help!

64
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,513
Help! Help!

65
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,959
Uncle Pai Yun, help!

66
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,676
Oh no, a dead end.

67
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,437
Help, help... I don't want to die... Help!

68
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,592
Master, help me... Master, help me!

69
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,918
I never really believed in miracles.

70
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,954
But at that moment, I really wanted
to fly up to the sky to thank her,

71
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,075
to take a closer look at her face.

72
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,990
But unfortunately, I was too tired.

73
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,077
When I met him, he was just
an ordinary military officer.

74
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,994
Who would have guessed he was
to become General Wu San Kuei,

75
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,998
who guarded Shanhaikwan and helped
to rewrite the history of Chung Yuan.

76
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,597
You were lucky I found you
in the woods this time.

77
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,793
Next time you may not be so lucky.

78
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,069
I alone am sober among the drunks.
Cheers!

79
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,159
Come again. Bottoms up.

80
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,118
I enjoyed being with him
because I got to do all

81
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,038
that was forbidden by my master.

82
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,072
Come on.

83
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,270
Yi Hang.

84
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,433
Fear not the criticisms of others, as
long as you are at peace with yourself.

85
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,710
What kind of a life would it be

86
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,677
if you always have
to look to others for approval?

87
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,432
You're better off dead.

88
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,915
I've said so much.
Did you hear any of it?

89
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,717
I didn't think a ferocious man like him
could have such a kind heart.

90
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,392
Sometimes I wondered if he was kind
to me only because I was an orphan.

91
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,076
Cho Yi Hang!

92
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,108
You stole a goat from
farmer Ho Tor Niu's home.

93
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,355
Do you plead guilty?

94
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,670
He not only stole my goat,
he gave me a bloody nose too! Look!

95
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,551
I was only trying to save
the goat from being butchered.

96
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,154
Master, you said
we should be chivalrous,

97
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,589
but they wouldn't even let
a little goat live.

98
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,230
Do you plead guilty
to injuring Ho Tor Niu?

99
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,992
He called me a beast and a bastard!

100
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,192
He was lucky
I didn't feed him dog shit!

101
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,836
What's so funny?

102
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,798
Chief, as the eldest student of Wu Tang
and successor to Joint Chief,

103
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,556
what Cho Yi Hang did was a disgrace to
the clan and to Wu Tang's reputation.

104
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,990
Actually, Uncle Pai Yun
was not really that bad.

105
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,754
He was just overly ambitious.

106
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,038
He wanted to defy tradition and have
his daughter succeed as Joint Chief.

107
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,276
As such, I became an eyesore to him.

108
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,036
Calligraphy, like swordplay,
calls for stamina.

109
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,111
This is my fellow student,
Brother Lu Hsin Cheng.

110
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,993
For all clans, stamina comes
from the brush and strength.

111
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,108
With spirit comes energy.

112
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,108
With spirit comes energy.

113
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,835
Energy moves the brush.

114
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,593
Energy moves the brush.

115
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,035
Waist more erect than brush.

116
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,276
Waist more erect than brush.

117
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,397
Wrist up!

118
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,277
Wrist up!

119
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,988
Arm like a dancing dragon.

120
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,270
Arm like a dancing dragon.

121
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,753
Sister Lu Hua is late!

122
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,876
Sorry, Dad.

123
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,831
Sit down.

124
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,354
Begin practicing calligraphy.

125
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,512
Cho Yi Hang, your punishment
is to copy 500 times.

126
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,715
I knew it.

127
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,117
Succumb not by poverty...

128
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,590
This is fellow student,
Sister Ho Lu Hua.

129
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,672
Did you notice she often smiled at me?

130
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,953
She frequently brought food
to cheer me up.

131
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,079
...It means not becoming indulgent
and losing your true self

132
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,037
when given wealth and power.

133
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,199
Yield not to prowess.

134
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,950
It means not submitting
to powerful influences.

135
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,117
Understand?

136
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,633
Cho Yi Hang, don't think
you can do whatever you want

137
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,598
just because the Chief is fond of you.

138
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,474
Look at your fellow students.
They missed dinner to practice writing.

139
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,079
And you're eating buns here?

140
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,712
Follow Lu Hua's example:
Pure as a virgin, crafty as a rabbit.

141
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,276
You're lazy and nonchalant!

142
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,791
I know Sister Lu Hua is
bright and ingenious

143
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,709
and the brothers are buds
waiting to bloom and flourish.

144
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,358
You, the eldest student, should serve
as an example to your brothers,

145
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,149
but instead you fool around during
lessons. Do you admit you're wrong?

146
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,031
Also, you left without permission and
cruelly killed Kaifeng's Constable Fang.

147
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,229
Do you plead guilty?

148
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,870
No.

149
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,077
Uncle Pai Yun, I stabbed him only once.

150
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,908
I wouldn't call that "cruel".

151
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,468
How can he talk this way?

152
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,913
How can he call himself
a student of Wu Tang?

153
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,228
That's against propriety.

154
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,074
I disagree, I feel that's not a problem.

155
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,636
So you're admitting guilt?

156
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,751
I admit I killed
the lowlife officer, but...

157
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,314
With rock solid proof,
you still try to argue?

158
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,115
I have nothing more to say,
but the lowlife officer's family has.

159
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,151
Everyone. Please do not
misunderstand Swordsman Cho.

160
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,878
My son was to blame
and he deserved to die.

161
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,628
Yes. We were lucky Swordsman Cho
came to the rescue.

162
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,075
Otherwise,
the bastard would have raped me!

163
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,117
He was going to kill my children too!

164
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,794
Thank you so much for saving our entire
family, Swordsman Cho. Thank you.

165
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,035
Get up! Get up please!

166
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,752
Silence in the palace!

167
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,675
Thank you.

168
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,756
Pai Yun, what wrong did
my unruly pupil do now

169
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,151
to have to trouble the presence
of the Eight Clans' elders?

170
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,993
He used his position of
the favorite pupil of the Chief

171
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,118
to do whatever he pleases and bullies
the students of the other clans.

172
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,949
With our witnesses here,
he can no longer deny it!

173
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,870
Yi Hang, what do you
have to say for yourself?

174
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,989
Chief, these are the students
of the Six Big Clans.

175
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,713
If I alone can beat them all,

176
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,077
it means Wu Tang's training and fighting
style is stronger and more powerful!

177
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,434
In that case, I plead guilty!

178
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,518
Quiet!

179
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,710
Brother Cho put it beautifully.

180
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,836
Quiet!

181
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,069
Ma Yu of Kung Tung Clan,
were you injured by Cho Yi Hang.

182
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,273
No. I just hurt myself in training.

183
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,472
And you, Liu Cheng of Tien Chuang Clan?

184
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,676
How were you hurt?

185
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,034
Oh, I hurt myself while playing.

186
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,513
What do the others have to say?

187
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,039
I fell into the well
while trying to get water.

188
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,990
I was chased by a tiger.

189
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,834
We were only joking.

190
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,116
You all leave now. Nonsense!

191
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,991
You!

192
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,713
I hit him because he went to
Wan Chun brothel and wouldn't pay.

193
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,750
You!

194
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,995
You conspired with some officials
and tried to take over a peasant's farm.

195
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,395
And you...

196
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,275
Just because you fight well, doesn't
mean you can harass the scholars.

197
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,116
Cho Yi Hang!

198
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,037
Yes.

199
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,150
You went away
without Master's permission.

200
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,551
You will be punished.
Face the Buddha in the palace

201
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,269
without a drop of water for three days
to think over your faults.

202
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,037
Yes.

203
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,879
You are always looking so stern.

204
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,353
Why don't you take a break?

205
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,030
You must be ecstatic to see me.

206
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,632
Are you hungry?
Here's something to eat.

207
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,151
Thank you.

208
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,548
You call that real food?

209
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,792
Look at the good stuff I brought.
Come on.

210
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,315
Cho...

211
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,833
Brother Cho,
we didn't mean to put you on the spot.

212
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,639
Master Pai Yun made us do it.

213
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,670
Yes...

214
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,797
You're not going to
hold a grudge, are you?

215
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,550
Of course not. It's already forgotten.

216
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,074
Thank you.

217
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,119
You, don't forget to pay
at the brothel next time.

218
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,039
Brother,
try this red kaoliang wine from Shansi.

219
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,076
Good.

220
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,116
You can just forget it.

221
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,554
Can't you see
Brother Cho is still holding

222
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,234
those two snow white buns
Sister Lu Hua gave him?

223
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,197
Hey, do you all know
this is the palace of Wu Tang?

224
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,078
Wine and meat, are you trying to get
Brother Cho into more trouble? Get out!

225
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,155
Get out of here!

226
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,871
What about me?

227
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,797
Yes, you too.

228
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,719
I'll go back to sleep
so you can sleep with Brother Cho!

229
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,191
What are you doing?

230
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,837
This jade heirloom is from my dad.

231
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,670
Now I'm giving it to you. But you'll
have to promise not to break it.

232
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,876
Don't go!

233
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,836
What do you want?

234
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,519
I have to go take a leak.

235
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,631
You stay here and cover for me.

236
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,469
Cho!

237
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,313
You're right. Now is the time
to serve the country.

238
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,275
Kill the rascals
and remove all evil spirits!

239
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,430
Yes!

240
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,430
Cho!

241
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,037
Stealing military food supplies
is a serious crime.

242
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,951
You may be beheaded.

243
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,315
Rather be beheaded
than to starve to death.

244
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,559
Come over here.
There's something to eat.

245
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,672
Don't fight! Everybody will get some.

246
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,790
You're with child, be careful.
Let me get it.

247
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,553
Come on.
Little sister, hurry up and eat.

248
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,829
How dare you beggars steal the Royal
Ching Palace military food supply!

249
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,597
Kill them all!

250
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,835
Honey, let's get going.

251
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,756
Honey, are you alright?

252
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,956
It hurts.

253
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,556
I haven't tasted foreign women
in a long time!

254
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,028
Honey, come on out! Quick!

255
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,235
Pretend we're dead.

256
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,029
Kill all these foreign beggars!

257
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,035
I'll kill you, you witch!

258
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,549
I'll chop you into nine pieces!

259
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,791
Exactly nine pieces!

260
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,232
Run, the witch is powerful!

261
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,196
Hurry up, run!

262
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,109
Honey, just hang in there!

263
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,115
Oh! I'm really hurting!

264
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,830
Darling, just hang on!

265
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,638
I can't! The baby is coming!

266
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,234
There's light in front.
Let's go find help. Come on.

267
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,598
- How come there's nobody here?
- It hurts!

268
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,951
Swordsman,
we didn't steal any food supplies.

269
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,275
Please don't kill us.

270
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,556
I beg you!

271
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,557
Honey!

272
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,955
Honey, are you alright?

273
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,080
Swordsman,
do you know how to deliver babies?

274
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,990
Please help us.

275
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,276
You want me to deliver your baby?

276
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,552
We beg you.
Please, please help us!

277
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,073
Honey, just hang on.

278
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,510
Honey, what do we do now?

279
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,317
Can you deliver babies? Please help us!

280
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,951
Honey, we've found help!

281
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,149
Push!

282
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,799
Harder, harder!

283
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,630
Honey!

284
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,035
Honey!

285
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,319
Honey, we've been through
even the most difficult times.

286
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,678
Why do you leave us now?

287
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,830
Don't be too sad.

288
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,358
You have a son. You have hope.

289
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,868
Take this to start a small business.

290
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,597
Come on.

291
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,395
Leave this place.

292
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,793
Thank you, Swordsman.
Thank you so much.

293
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,356
Who are you?

294
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,508
Why do you follow me?

295
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,032
Miss, you're the one
who brought us so close together.

296
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,356
That's more like it.

297
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,597
It's better to keep
a little distance between us.

298
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,357
Whoever has laid eyes on me
must be blinded!

299
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,280
Wow! I've seen your entire body.

300
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,157
Does that mean I'll have
to die a horrible death?

301
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,589
Miss, what a temper.

302
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,108
"Come back to the palace at once."

303
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,432
Darn! I didn't even get a chance
to tell her my name is Cho Yi Hang.

304
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:42,038
Lord of the Supreme Cult,
blessed by slaughter and bloodshed.

305
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:07,034
Today, Chief Convoy led our army

306
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,113
and wiped out many
from the orthodox clans.

307
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,313
I want them to know that

308
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,557
our tribesmen are not ants
under their feet.

309
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:34,157
Chief Convoy's superb blood discipline
keeps away all evil spirits.

310
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,478
Those old windbags of
Chung Yuan's Eight Clans...

311
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,992
they're so old
they can't even hold up their swords.

312
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,789
All they have left are their mouths!

313
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,116
They use their words
to befuddle the masses.

314
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,077
Not only do they want
to unite Chung Yuan,

315
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,390
they even want to dig up
our ancestors' graves.

316
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,677
Damn nuisance!

317
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,036
If we can dispose of those old dogs,
the Eight Clans of Chung Yuan

318
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,271
will be like a bucket of loose sand.

319
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:34,039
Slay the dogs, increase our longevity!

320
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,910
You've been as cold as ice all night.

321
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,472
My brother and I have been suppressed
for 20 years.

322
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,949
Now is the time for you to repay us.

323
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,037
You, kill them all for me!

324
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,957
Your heart is beating so fast.

325
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,475
Let me feel it.

326
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,033
Have you finished giving orders?

327
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,756
What are you laughing at?

328
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,194
Little brother, you're so pathetic.

329
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,276
You've spoiled her.
Now she won't even let you touch her.

330
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,596
True love has to be mutual.

331
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,715
I'll wait for her.

332
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,199
You're right.
Coerced love gives no happiness.

333
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,350
Coerced love gives no happiness!

334
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,869
Master Tze Yang, the evil cult grows
increasingly powerful in Manchuria.

335
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,076
It's now threatening the safety
of the people of Ming.

336
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,593
As the Joint Chief of the Eight Clans,
you should do something.

337
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,034
Chi Wu Shuang's reappearance
means the world

338
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,908
is once again filled with witchcraft
and evil spirits.

339
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,715
We must eliminate them before they
completely take over.

340
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,711
That's easier said than done.

341
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,189
I've heard the Chi siblings
are excellent fighters.

342
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,989
Chief, we shouldn't have let
the wicked Chi go so easily years ago.

343
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,230
There's no point
in dragging out the past now.

344
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,192
What we must decide now
is which clan should lead our troops.

345
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,916
What is your opinion?

346
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,915
As head of the Eight Clans,
Wu Tang is the obvious choice.

347
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,679
That's right.

348
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,557
Hsin Cheng.

349
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,030
Yes, Master?

350
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,428
Where's Yi Hang?

351
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,837
Where have you been?

352
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,629
Master is meeting with
the Seven Big Clans inside.

353
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,588
Wait. What did you do
with the jade I gave you?

354
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,195
Why are you asking me this now?

355
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,588
Where is the jade?

356
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,159
Why did you give it away?

357
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,236
I thought he needed it more than I did.

358
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,388
I killed him. I don't think
you'll need it anymore either.

359
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,633
Brother Cho, Master is looking for you.

360
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,232
I'm sorry, Chief. I'm late.

361
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,479
Yi Hang, the Eight Big Clans decided to
send troops to suppress the evil cult.

362
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,519
I want you in command of the troops.

363
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,353
Chief, I'm afraid I may not be
the best person for this colossal task.

364
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,192
Wu Tang is full of talents.

365
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,240
Why does Master only have
Yi Hang in his eyes?

366
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,508
Do you have a better suggestion?

367
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,200
If I may be so bold as
to suggest my daughter, Lu Hua.

368
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,270
She would make a perfect commander.

369
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,637
Right!

370
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,669
Sister Lu Hua is brilliant,
decisive and fast with her sword.

371
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,353
She would be best to take
the reins of command.

372
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,510
That won't do!
That's against tradition!

373
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,238
Is that right, Master?

374
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,200
That's right.

375
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,110
What do you think?

376
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,191
Chief, how can a woman undertake
such an important role?

377
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,229
Yi Hang!

378
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,115
Military orders are
as rigid as the mountains.

379
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,150
You cannot defy order!

380
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,953
You will command the pupils
of the Eight Clans

381
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,593
and Lu Hua will be
your second in command.

382
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,234
Set out at dusk!

383
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,029
Yes, Master!

384
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,953
Yi Hang, I tried to speak well of you
in front of the Eight Clans.

385
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,672
Why did you go against me?

386
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,790
Master, please listen to me...

387
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,108
No, you listen to me!

388
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,677
I've spent all these years teaching you.

389
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,834
My hope was that after my death
you would succeed me

390
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,798
as the Joint Chief of the Eight Clans.

391
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,949
I knew if I were to lead the masses,
I must do things against my convictions.

392
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,109
That's right.

393
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,798
I can't believe being kind-hearted
is a fault.

394
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,237
Kind-hearted?

395
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:42,280
Let me ask you this. If one day,
Chi Wu Shuang wants to destroy Wu Tang,

396
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,794
would you be able
to ask him to spare us?

397
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,393
And, if one day, Chung Yuan came under
the rule of the foreign tribes

398
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,275
and all Han people must be executed,

399
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,199
would you be able to use
your kindness to move them?

400
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,110
This is the unwritten law of the land.

401
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,713
Therefore, you have no choice!

402
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,439
Yes, I do.

403
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,830
I can quit and become a recluse.

404
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,996
Quit?

405
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,557
It's easier said than done!

406
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,670
What else do you know
besides a little kung fu?

407
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,556
You want to go home and farm?

408
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,995
The Chief himself said that you would be
the one to succeed him as Joint Chief.

409
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,996
Everyone from the Eight Big Clans
has their eye on this title.

410
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,952
And you're not interested in it?
I am a little more ambitious.

411
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,675
My little friend,
look not only at the present.

412
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:18,280
Should you really become Joint Chief,
then we could join forces.

413
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,672
We may even be the ones
to change Ming's history!

414
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,156
General, we caught some infiltrators.

415
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,191
Behead them all!

416
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,594
Yes, behead them all!

417
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,549
We're innocent...

418
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,994
Uncle Kuei, why did you...

419
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,230
At this critical time, it's better
to wrongly kill 1 00 than to let one go.

420
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,632
The evil cult wants
to take over our land

421
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,749
and the Manchurians are getting
increasingly rampant.

422
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,755
Our duty as military men
is to protect the land

423
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,635
and destroy them
to the point of no return.

424
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,590
Yi Hang, remember, heroes make history.

425
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,872
Why is Brother Cho not here yet?

426
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,359
Let's not wait for Cho Yi Hang anymore.

427
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,149
Let's plan how we can deploy
our forces to fight the evil cult.

428
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,237
Chi Wu Shuang's kung fu has such depth.
We don't fully know about the evil cult.

429
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,918
A move now may be too dangerous.

430
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,357
If Kung Tung Clan isn't confident of its
abilities, there is time to back out.

431
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,390
I don't believe our Seven Clans
Coalition can't handle Chi Wu Shuang.

432
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,235
How about the wolf girl?

433
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,438
And we have Wu Tang's
72 Cyclical Swords.

434
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,436
And Hua Shan Clan's...

435
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,396
Seven Fatal Arrays.

436
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,555
Be quiet. I know.

437
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,560
And we have O-Mei Clan's
Dragon-Tiger Conquering Moves.

438
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,233
And Kun Lun Clan's
lncredible Kam Kong Swordplay.

439
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,751
If we take a stab at her
while she isn't looking...

440
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,154
it doesn't matter if she's a wolf girl,

441
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,039
even a dragon girl
will be turned into minced meat!

442
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,189
My elders.

443
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,192
Cho Yi Hang would like
to ask you a question.

444
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,358
The foreign tribes
have done us no wrong.

445
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,115
Why must we kill them all?

446
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,717
Brother.

447
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,194
You are so eager to kill.

448
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,350
Let me ask you,

449
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,714
have you ever heard
the sound of a sword when

450
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,156
it slices through a human body
or hits a human skull?

451
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,391
Cho Yi Hang,
as Commander of the Eight Clans,

452
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,949
how dare you disrupt the morale
of our forces with your grotesque words!

453
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,120
You are so ambitious and can't wait
to make a name for yourself.

454
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,316
You're much more suited
to be the Commander in charge.

455
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,355
I hate patrolling at this late hour!
It's freezing!

456
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,957
Something seems wrong ahead.

457
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,156
Nobody's there.
Maybe you've had a few drinks too many.
