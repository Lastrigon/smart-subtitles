1
00:00:16.194 --> 00:00:20.439
Having spent 18 years as a child of the state

2
00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.745
in children's homes and foster care,

3
00:00:22.745 --> 00:00:25.793
you could say that I'm an expert on the subject,

4
00:00:25.793 --> 00:00:29.351
and in being an expert, I want to let you know that

5
00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:34.957
being an expert does in no way make you right

6
00:00:34.957 --> 00:00:37.958
in light of the truth.

7
00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:42.146
If you're in care, legally the government is your

8
00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:45.873
parent, loco parentis.

9
00:00:45.873 --> 00:00:49.821
Margaret Thatcher was my mother. (Laughter)

10
00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:53.471
Let's not talk about breastfeeding. (Laughter)

11
00:00:53.471 --> 00:00:56.609
Harry Potter was a foster child.

12
00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.649
Pip from "Great Expectations" was adopted;

13
00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.731
Superman was a foster child;

14
00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:08.258
Cinderella was a foster child;

15
00:01:08.258 --> 00:01:11.866
Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo,

16
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.789
was fostered and institutionalized;

17
00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.164
Batman was orphaned;

18
00:01:19.164 --> 00:01:22.862
Lyra Belacqua from Philip Pullman's "Northern Lights"

19
00:01:22.862 --> 00:01:24.550
was fostered;

20
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.285
Jane Eyre, adopted;

21
00:01:27.285 --> 00:01:31.868
Roald Dahl's James from "James and the Giant Peach;"

22
00:01:31.868 --> 00:01:37.380
Matilda; Moses -- Moses! (Laughter)

23
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.828
Moses! (Laughter) --

24
00:01:39.828 --> 00:01:44.324
the boys in Michael Morpurgo's "Friend or Foe;"

25
00:01:44.324 --> 00:01:48.140
Alem in Benjamin Zephaniah's "Refugee Boy;"

26
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.723
Luke Skywalker --

27
00:01:50.723 --> 00:01:53.594
Luke Skywalker! (Laughter) --

28
00:01:53.594 --> 00:01:55.882
Oliver Twist;

29
00:01:55.882 --> 00:02:00.920
Cassia in "The Concubine of Shanghai" by Hong Ying;

30
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.449
Celie in Alice Walker's "The Color Purple."

31
00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:08.620
All of these great fictional characters, all of them

32
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.590
who were hurt by their condition,

33
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.707
all of them who spawned thousands of other books

34
00:02:16.707 --> 00:02:19.162
and other films, all of them

35
00:02:19.162 --> 00:02:23.314
were fostered, adopted or orphaned.

36
00:02:23.314 --> 00:02:28.878
It seems that writers know that the child

37
00:02:28.878 --> 00:02:36.280
outside of family reflects on what family truly is

38
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.618
more than what it promotes itself to be.

39
00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:44.584
That is, they also use extraordinary skills

40
00:02:44.584 --> 00:02:49.413
to deal with extraordinary situations on a daily basis.

41
00:02:49.413 --> 00:02:52.935
How have we not made the connection?

42
00:02:52.935 --> 00:02:56.973
And why have we not made the connection, between

43
00:02:56.973 --> 00:02:59.173
— How has that happened? —

44
00:02:59.173 --> 00:03:02.742
between these incredible characters of popular culture

45
00:03:02.742 --> 00:03:07.829
and religions, and the fostered, adopted or orphaned child

46
00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.461
in our midst? It's not our pity that they need.

47
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:15.620
It's our respect.

48
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.680
I know famous musicians,

49
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.752
I know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists

50
00:03:22.752 --> 00:03:26.252
and top lawyers and television executives

51
00:03:26.252 --> 00:03:28.702
and magazine editors and national journalists

52
00:03:28.702 --> 00:03:31.543
and dustbinmen and hairdressers, all who were

53
00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:35.800
looked after children, fostered, adopted or orphaned,

54
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.752
and many of them grow into their adult lives

55
00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:42.230
in fear of speaking of their background, as if it may

56
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.329
somehow weaken their standing in the foreground,

57
00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.372
as if it were somehow Kryptonite, as if it were a time bomb

58
00:03:50.372 --> 00:03:54.419
strapped on the inside. Children in care,

59
00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.552
who've had a life in care, deserve the right

60
00:03:57.552 --> 00:04:03.402
to own and live the memory of their own childhood.

61
00:04:03.402 --> 00:04:05.682
It is that simple.

62
00:04:05.682 --> 00:04:09.687
My own mother — and I should say this here —

63
00:04:09.687 --> 00:04:13.542
she same to this country in the late '60s,

64
00:04:13.542 --> 00:04:17.307
and she was, you know, she found herself pregnant,

65
00:04:17.307 --> 00:04:19.401
as women did in the late '60s. You know what I mean?

66
00:04:19.401 --> 00:04:21.351
They found themselves pregnant.

67
00:04:21.351 --> 00:04:26.250
And she sort of, she had no idea of the context

68
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.145
in which she'd landed.

69
00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:33.992
In the 1960s -- I should give you some context -- in the 1960s,

70
00:04:33.992 --> 00:04:37.343
if you were pregnant and you were single,

71
00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:40.245
you were seen as a threat to the community.

72
00:04:40.245 --> 00:04:46.103
You were separated from your family by the state.

73
00:04:46.103 --> 00:04:48.806
You were separated from your family and placed into

74
00:04:48.806 --> 00:04:50.927
mother and baby homes.

75
00:04:50.927 --> 00:04:54.680
You were appointed a social worker.

76
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.459
The adoptive parents were lined up.

77
00:04:56.459 --> 00:05:00.544
It was the primary purpose of the social worker, the aim,

78
00:05:00.544 --> 00:05:03.884
to get the woman at her most vulnerable time

79
00:05:03.884 --> 00:05:09.238
in her entire life, to sign the adoption papers.

80
00:05:09.238 --> 00:05:11.122
So the adoption papers were signed.

81
00:05:11.122 --> 00:05:14.693
The mother and baby's homes were often run by nuns.

82
00:05:14.693 --> 00:05:17.868
The adoption papers were signed,

83
00:05:17.868 --> 00:05:21.565
the child was given to the adoptive parents, and the mother

84
00:05:21.565 --> 00:05:23.989
shipped back to her community

85
00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:26.979
to say that she'd been on a little break.

86
00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.665
A little break.

87
00:05:29.665 --> 00:05:31.343
A little break.

88
00:05:31.343 --> 00:05:34.908
The first secret of shame for a woman

89
00:05:34.908 --> 00:05:39.987
for being a woman, "a little break."

90
00:05:39.987 --> 00:05:43.790
The adoption process took, like, a matter of months,

91
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.958
so it was a closed shop, you know, sealed deal,

92
00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:53.464
an industrious, utilitarian solution:

93
00:05:53.464 --> 00:05:56.821
the government, the farmer,

94
00:05:56.821 --> 00:06:00.669
the adopting parents, the consumer,

95
00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:05.470
the mother, the earth, and the child, the crop.

96
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.124
It's kind of easy to patronize the past,

97
00:06:10.124 --> 00:06:15.280
to forego our responsibilities in the present.

98
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.880
What happened then is a direct reflection

99
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.124
of what is happening now. Everybody believed themselves

100
00:06:24.124 --> 00:06:28.661
to be doing the right thing by God and by the state

101
00:06:28.661 --> 00:06:35.548
for the big society, fast-tracking adoption.

102
00:06:35.548 --> 00:06:40.741
So anyway, she comes here, 1967, she's pregnant,

103
00:06:40.741 --> 00:06:45.819
and she comes from Ethiopia that was celebrating

104
00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.518
its own jubilee at the time

105
00:06:48.518 --> 00:06:51.288
under the Emperor Haile Selassie,

106
00:06:51.288 --> 00:06:56.413
and she lands months before the Enoch Powell speech,

107
00:06:56.413 --> 00:06:58.534
the "Rivers of Blood" speech.

108
00:06:58.534 --> 00:07:03.156
She lands months before the Beatles release "The White Album,"

109
00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:05.839
months before Martin Luther King was killed.

110
00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:08.290
It was a summer of love if you were white.

111
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.983
If you were black, it was a summer of hate.

112
00:07:11.983 --> 00:07:17.633
So she goes from Oxford, she's sent to the north of England

113
00:07:17.633 --> 00:07:21.992
to a mother and baby home, and appointed a social worker.

114
00:07:21.992 --> 00:07:26.232
It's her plan. You know, I have to say this in the Houses --

115
00:07:26.232 --> 00:07:30.504
It's her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time

116
00:07:30.504 --> 00:07:34.790
while she studies. But the social worker,

117
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.720
he had a different agenda.

118
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.280
He found the foster parents, and he said to them,

119
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.112
"Treat this as an adoption. He's yours forever.

120
00:07:45.112 --> 00:07:48.558
His name is Norman." (Laughter)

121
00:07:48.558 --> 00:07:50.895
Norman! (Laughter)

122
00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:53.607
Norman!

123
00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:59.833
So they took me. I was a message, they said.

124
00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:02.293
I was a sign from God, they said.

125
00:08:02.293 --> 00:08:06.360
I was Norman Mark Greenwood.

126
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.455
Now, for the next 11 years, all I know is that this woman,

127
00:08:09.455 --> 00:08:12.430
this birth woman, should have her eyes scratched out

128
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.460
for not signing the adoption papers. She was an evil woman

129
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.122
too selfish to sign, so I spent those 11 years

130
00:08:18.122 --> 00:08:20.879
kneeling and praying.

131
00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:23.999
I tried praying. I swear I tried praying.

132
00:08:23.999 --> 00:08:27.808
"God, can I have a bike for Christmas?"

133
00:08:27.808 --> 00:08:32.155
But I would always answer myself, "Yes, of course you can."

134
00:08:32.155 --> 00:08:33.770
(Laughter)

135
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.507
And then I was supposed to determine whether that

136
00:08:36.507 --> 00:08:40.390
was the voice of God or it was the voice of the Devil.

137
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:47.398
And it turns out I've got the Devil inside of me.

138
00:08:47.398 --> 00:08:49.806
Who knew? (Laughter)

139
00:08:49.806 --> 00:08:52.701
So anyway, two years sort of passed,

140
00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:54.479
and they had a child of their own,

141
00:08:54.479 --> 00:08:56.944
and then another two years passed, and they had another child of their own,

142
00:08:56.944 --> 00:08:59.235
and then another time passed

143
00:08:59.235 --> 00:09:01.811
and they had another child that they called an accident,

144
00:09:01.811 --> 00:09:05.219
which I thought was an unusual name. (Laughter)

145
00:09:05.219 --> 00:09:08.948
And I was on the cusp of, sort of, adolescence,

146
00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:13.354
so I was starting to take biscuits from the tin without asking.

147
00:09:13.354 --> 00:09:17.130
I was starting to stay out a little bit late, etc., etc.

148
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.534
Now, in their religiosity, in their naivete,

149
00:09:20.534 --> 00:09:22.970
my mom and dad, which I believed them to be forever,

150
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:26.238
as they said they were, my mom and dad

151
00:09:26.238 --> 00:09:33.470
conceived that I had the Devil inside of me.

152
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.106
And what -- I should say this here, because this is how

153
00:09:35.106 --> 00:09:37.650
they engineered my leaving.

154
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.454
They sat me at a table, my foster mom, and she said to me,

155
00:09:40.454 --> 00:09:42.522
"You don't love us, do you?" At 11 years old.

156
00:09:42.522 --> 00:09:46.300
They've had three other children. I'm the fourth. The third was an accident.

157
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.760
And I said, "Yeah, of course I do." Because you do.

158
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.226
My foster mother asked me to go away to think about love

159
00:09:52.226 --> 00:09:55.700
and what it is and to read the Scriptures and to come back tomorrow

160
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.130
and give my most honest and truthful answer.

161
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.854
So this was an opportunity. If they were asking me

162
00:10:00.854 --> 00:10:03.189
whether I loved them or not, then I mustn't love them,

163
00:10:03.189 --> 00:10:06.540
which led me to the miracle of thought that I thought they wanted me to get to.

164
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.726
"I will ask God for forgiveness and His light will shine

165
00:10:08.726 --> 00:10:12.494
through me to them. How fantastic." This was an opportunity.

166
00:10:12.494 --> 00:10:15.278
The theology was perfect, the timing unquestionable,

167
00:10:15.278 --> 00:10:18.182
and the answer as honest as a sinner could get.

168
00:10:18.182 --> 00:10:22.869
"I mustn't love you," I said to them. "But I will ask God for forgiveness."

169
00:10:22.869 --> 00:10:25.421
"Because you don't love us, Norman,

170
00:10:25.421 --> 00:10:27.766
clearly you've chosen your path."

171
00:10:27.766 --> 00:10:30.563
Twenty-four hours later, my social worker,

172
00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:33.612
this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months,

173
00:10:33.612 --> 00:10:36.825
he's waiting for me in the car as I say goodbye to my parents.

174
00:10:36.825 --> 00:10:39.400
I didn't say goodbye to anybody, not my mother, my father,

175
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.229
my sisters, my brothers, my aunts, my uncles,

176
00:10:41.229 --> 00:10:44.857
my cousins, my grandparents, nobody.

177
00:10:44.857 --> 00:10:48.404
On the way to the children's home, I started to ask myself,

178
00:10:48.404 --> 00:10:51.380
"What's happened to me?"

179
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.532
It's not that I'd had the rug pulled from beneath me

180
00:10:54.532 --> 00:10:59.348
as much as the entire floor had been taken away.

181
00:10:59.348 --> 00:11:03.148
When I got to the —

182
00:11:03.148 --> 00:11:07.531
For the next four, five years,

183
00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:12.383
I was held in four different children's homes.

184
00:11:12.383 --> 00:11:15.660
On the third children's home, at 15,

185
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.828
I started to rebel, and what I did was,

186
00:11:18.828 --> 00:11:23.156
I got three tins of paint, Airfix paint that you use for models,

187
00:11:23.156 --> 00:11:26.988
and I was -- it was a big children's home, big Victorian children's home --

188
00:11:26.988 --> 00:11:28.827
and I was in a little turret at the top of it,

189
00:11:28.827 --> 00:11:32.131
and I poured them, red, yellow and green,

190
00:11:32.131 --> 00:11:37.171
the colors of Africa, down the tiles.

191
00:11:37.171 --> 00:11:39.676
You couldn't see it from the street, because the home

192
00:11:39.676 --> 00:11:42.128
was surrounded by beech trees.

193
00:11:42.128 --> 00:11:47.830
For doing this, I was incarcerated for a year

194
00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.690
in an assessment center which was actually

195
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.788
a remand center. It was a virtual prison

196
00:11:54.788 --> 00:11:58.686
for young people.

197
00:11:58.686 --> 00:12:00.740
By the way, years later, my social worker said

198
00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.198
that I should never have been put in there.

199
00:12:02.198 --> 00:12:04.853
I wasn't charged for anything. I hadn't done anything wrong.

200
00:12:04.853 --> 00:12:09.579
But because I had no family to inquire about me,

201
00:12:09.579 --> 00:12:14.331
they could do anything to me.

202
00:12:14.331 --> 00:12:17.685
I'm 17 years old, and

203
00:12:17.685 --> 00:12:21.325
they had a padded cell.

204
00:12:21.325 --> 00:12:27.285
They would march me down corridors in last-size order.

205
00:12:27.285 --> 00:12:29.550
They -- I was put in a dormitory

206
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:33.470
with a confirmed Nazi sympathizer.

207
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.793
All of the staff were ex-police -- interesting --

208
00:12:36.793 --> 00:12:38.806
and ex-probation officers.

209
00:12:38.806 --> 00:12:42.870
The man who ran it was an ex-army officer.

210
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.300
Every time I had a visit by a person who I did not know

211
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.764
who would feed me grapes, once every three months,

212
00:12:49.764 --> 00:12:51.974
I was strip-searched.

213
00:12:51.974 --> 00:12:55.228
That home was full of young boys who were on remand

214
00:12:55.228 --> 00:13:00.495
for things like murder.

215
00:13:00.495 --> 00:13:04.528
And this was the preparation that I was being given

216
00:13:04.528 --> 00:13:10.579
after 17 years as a child of the state.

217
00:13:10.579 --> 00:13:13.162
I have to tell this story.

218
00:13:13.162 --> 00:13:15.431
I have to tell it, because there was no one

219
00:13:15.431 --> 00:13:18.385
to put two and two together.

220
00:13:18.385 --> 00:13:21.412
I slowly became aware that I knew nobody

221
00:13:21.412 --> 00:13:24.906
that knew me for longer than a year.

222
00:13:24.906 --> 00:13:27.755
See, that's what family does.

223
00:13:27.755 --> 00:13:30.146
It gives you reference points.

224
00:13:30.146 --> 00:13:32.633
I'm not defining a good family from a bad family.

225
00:13:32.633 --> 00:13:34.450
I'm just saying that you know when your birthday is

226
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.106
by virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is,

227
00:13:37.106 --> 00:13:39.520
a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, an aunt, an uncle,

228
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.630
a cousin, a grandparent. It matters to someone,

229
00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.349
and therefore it matters to you. Understand,

230
00:13:43.349 --> 00:13:47.579
I was 14 years old, tucked away in myself, into myself,

231
00:13:47.579 --> 00:13:52.360
and I wasn't touched either, physically touched.

232
00:13:52.360 --> 00:14:00.487
I'm reporting back. I'm reporting back simply to say that

233
00:14:00.487 --> 00:14:03.702
when I left the children's home I had two things

234
00:14:03.702 --> 00:14:07.500
that I wanted to do. One was to find my family,

235
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.300
and the other was to write poetry.

236
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.579
In creativity I saw light.

237
00:14:11.579 --> 00:14:16.740
In the imagination I saw the endless possibility of life,

238
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:22.642
the endless truth, the permanent creation of reality,

239
00:14:22.642 --> 00:14:29.104
the place where anger was an expression

240
00:14:29.104 --> 00:14:32.853
in the search for love, a place where dysfunction

241
00:14:32.853 --> 00:14:37.571
is a true reaction to untruth.

242
00:14:37.571 --> 00:14:41.117
I've just got to say it to you all: I found all of my family

243
00:14:41.117 --> 00:14:44.481
in my adult life. I spent all of my adult life finding them,

244
00:14:44.481 --> 00:14:48.496
and I've now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else.

245
00:14:48.496 --> 00:14:52.236
But I'm reporting back to you to say quite simply

246
00:14:52.236 --> 00:14:57.748
that you can define how strong a democracy is

247
00:14:57.748 --> 00:15:02.981
by how its government treats its child.

248
00:15:02.981 --> 00:15:05.370
I don't mean children. I mean the child of the state.

249
00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:10.400
Thanks very much. It's been an honor. (Applause)

250
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:20.400
(Applause)
