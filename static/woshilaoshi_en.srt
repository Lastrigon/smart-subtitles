1
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,900
What are you doing ?

2
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,200
If you don't want to learn

3
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,200
then get out.

4
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,700
Get out!

5
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,600
For the sake of the students
who still remain here, I won't give up.

6
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,600
Until the other students come back,
we must study hard.

7
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,600
Class President, where were we?

8
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:07,000
- Class President?
- He left already.

9
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,600
It's my fault.

10
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,600
Because I'm not a good teacher.

11
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,700
Students...

12
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,300
Go ahead and hit me.

13
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
I don't have the right to be your teacher.

14
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,600
Hurry, hit me.

15
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,900
Hurry!

16
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,999
Hold on!

17
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,700
Class President

18
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:25,300
What are you doing?

19
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,401
Class President

20
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,900
Seeing you here, it's like I find my life again.

21
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,800
Hit from this end, it hurts more.

22
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,800
Class President.

23
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,600
You call yourself a human being?

24
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,025
You're supposed to be
the best teacher in Korea!

25
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,100
It's been 3 months and
she  gets a measly 17 points?

26
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,700
Understanding math doesn't happen in a day.

27
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,900
Why would I have forked over
all that money just to wait?

28
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:19,800
Your daughter isn't clued in to math concepts...

29
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,800
Are you saying my daughter doesn't have a clue?

30
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,400
That's not what I mean!

31
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,200
Mr. Kim!

32
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,300
Yes, chairman.

33
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,800
If I'm paying tens of thousands of dollars,
she should at least pretend to study!

34
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,200
That's it!

35
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,400
- Move aside.
- Chairman!

36
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,400
Don't worry!  He won't be able to do it.

37
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:32,200
Chairman!

38
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:06,300
Where are you?

39
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,740
I told you to knock.

40
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,201
You!

41
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,500
You said you don't like looking ignorant.

42
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:25,000
Kosun, Kosun!  Kodol is looking for you.
Come on out.

43
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,370
How many has it been?

44
00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:30,150
Do you know how expensive
all those teachers you kick out are?

45
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,400
Don't you think you should at least
have a high school degree?

46
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,600
You did just fine without one.

47
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,800
- Are you planning to live like me?
- What's wrong with that?

48
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,900
I'm not saying there's something wrong with it.

49
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:48,900
No matter what anyone says,
I'm very proud of you, daddy.

50
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,200
Really?

51
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,600
Then go study abroad.
I found a nice place in the US.

52
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,100
- I heard there aren't any hot guys there.
- Do you study abroad for the guys?

53
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,530
Then why did you quit the private
school known for having all the boys?

54
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,000
- There were no teachers.
- What?

55
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,800
Are you saying the students
studied without teachers there?

56
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,600
I mean that all of them were sucking up to me.

57
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,800
How am I supposed to respect
teachers who only care about money?

58
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,446
What's the big deal about respect?

59
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:37,000
In the old days, we would actually
thank the teachers for hitting us.

60
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,800
You should be thankful that you don't get hit.

61
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,400
If there are any teachers brave enough
to hit me, I'd probably study hard.

62
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,800
I don't care if the teacher's
grandfather came by.

63
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,700
If anyone dared to lay a finger on my baby,
I'd bust up both of their legs.

64
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,100
Don't you think that you're overprotecting?

65
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,955
It would look so nice seeing you do that at your age.

66
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,609
Right, Eun Byul.

67
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,173
That's why you should just listen
to your dad and get married.

68
00:08:07,703 --> 00:08:11,582
Not that again, do you want me to run away again?

69
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,350
What's the big deal?

70
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,800
If you went to the trouble of running away,
you shouldn't have come back.

71
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,600
Fine.  If I do it again, I won't come back.
Don't regret it.

72
00:08:20,814 --> 00:08:22,000
You rude little...

73
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:25,123
Anyways, starting today, you are surrounded.
Understand?

74
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,690
You mean grounded.

75
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:28,810
Same thing.

76
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,000
If you don't listen to your dad,
where is that spider?

77
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,200
I'm going to kill it.  Got that?

78
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,900
Hey, here it is.

79
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,100
Daddy will buy another one for you right away.

80
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,893
2...3...

81
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,500
I will buy you ten of them, Eun Byul.

82
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,700
Eun Byul.  Eun Byul!
Where are you going?

83
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,100
Starry nights make me dream.

84
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,400
He wanted to draw the beautiful
September stars shinning on the Rhone River.

85
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,400
It looks just like the Han River.

86
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:43,431
Van Gogh thought that there was a lot of
pain hidden behind all these clear stars.

87
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,609
These guys don't really look like
they're in that much pain.

88
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,212
Your personality shines through,
even when you look at paintings.

89
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,300
He used a lot of colors
just to portray one star.

90
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Looking at it from a distance,
it looks like it's glimmering.

91
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,100
A light with lots of colors.

92
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,400
- Good work today, Mr. Jang.
- It's ok.

93
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,200
I think the art department has found
a good place for studying paintings.

94
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,800
Thanks to you, this country boy has
lost another layer of ignorance.

95
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Would you like some tea?

96
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,300
She looks like a student, doesn't she?

97
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,800
A student shouldn't act like that.

98
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,600
You're a student, right?

99
00:12:11,802 --> 00:12:16,000
Cigarettes destroy your bones.

100
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,400
They're notorious for stunting
the growth of teenagers today.

101
00:12:20,401 --> 00:12:21,600
also...

102
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,500
a female student shouldn't be
out alone at this hour.

103
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:34,800
- Hello?  Dad.  Yes.
- This isn't the best of neighborhoods.

104
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,400
Yes, I'll be right in.  Yes.

105
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,000
Anyways, be careful.

106
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,800
I've taken care of everything. It's fine now.

107
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,400
But Mr. Jang, what should I do?

108
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,121
My dad is in town and says
he's waiting outside my house.

109
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,425
I think I'd better go home now.

110
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:59,790
Then I better take you home quickly.

111
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,120
Mister.

112
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,700
What?  What?

113
00:13:07,735 --> 00:13:10,650
I think what you said was right.

114
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,330
I feel it to the core.

115
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:21,995
In light of that, please escort me home.

116
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,000
Why me?  If you're going to go, you should go.

117
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,000
Right.

118
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,538
Who would think twice
about a kid like me, right?

119
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,950
I'll just go home alone.

120
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm scared of this neighborhood, though.

121
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,100
That's because I'm a little busy right now.

122
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,700
Teacher Jang, take her home.

123
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,000
- No, it's okay.
- I feel bad for her.

124
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Miss Shin...

125
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,500
I can just catch a cab home.

126
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,400
Which way do you live?

127
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,880
Mister

128
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,640
My stomach

129
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:36,500
What? What? Stomach spasms?
Indigestion?  The bathroom?

130
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,120
Let's eat.

131
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,600
Thanks for the meal.

132
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,800
Here eat

133
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,000
You're a growing girl. Eat

134
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,700
Where do you live?
What school do you go to?

135
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,500
- Are you trying to pick me up?
- Wha

136
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,200
How could you...

137
00:15:31,076 --> 00:15:34,405
Hey, I'm currently a teacher.

138
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,765
No wonder you have no style.

139
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,850
- What do you mean?
- You're really a teacher?

140
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,630
Does everyone lie to you?

141
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:54,500
Look here, I am a teacher at MyungMoon High School.

142
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,900
Lend me some money.

143
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,600
What?

144
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,715
Lend me some money.
I'll pay you right back.

145
00:16:09,697 --> 00:16:11,310
Did you run away?

146
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,450
Are you done eating?

147
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,200
- How much is it?
- 10 dollars

148
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,800
Come again.

149
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,000
Where are you going?
You're not going home?

150
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,700
If you don't want to lend me
the money, then just say so.

151
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,080
Lending money is not the problem.
I don't think like that.

152
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:48,597
You said you want to go home,
then why do you borrow some money?

153
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,600
You lie about going home,
then you're going else where, right?

154
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,800
You!  Running away from home like this,
don't you know that your parents are worried about you?

155
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,800
No one will worry about me.

156
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,000
My mom passed away when I was a child.

157
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,600
My dad, he hits me everyday.

158
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,000
Is that right?

159
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,700
It's alright if you don't want to help me.

160
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,500
How can I not have a place to go?

161
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,600
Hey, wait a minute.
I'll find some right away.

162
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,100
This is your house?

163
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,700
- What's with the light?
- Why did you come in here?

164
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,000
- What are you doing that's taking so long?
- Just hang on for a second.

165
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,300
- Oh no, it went out.
- It does that sometimes. Just stay still.

166
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:33,800
What's wrong with you?
What's that noise?

167
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,990
- What are you doing?
- Just hold still.

168
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:42,400
Just hold still a minute!
Just hold still!

169
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,800
Hey, let go!

170
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,100
I told you to hold still.

171
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,710
What am I going to do?
I'm soaking wet!

172
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,705
Then why did you follow me in here?

173
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,800
Mister

174
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,415
Something is on the wall.

175
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,902
It's just a cockroach.

176
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,900
Wait, there's some newspaper.

177
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,200
I killed it, so you clean it up.

178
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,200
I'm soaked.
Where is your bathroom?

179
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,900
Over there.

180
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,700
Looking for this?

181
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,870
You're probably uncomfortable,
so you can wear this.

182
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,380
I'm busy, so I'm going first.

183
00:22:43,385 --> 00:22:46,772
It's late, so try and get some sleep here.

184
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,600
And be sure to lock the door.

185
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,537
010-6235-0636

186
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,102
It's my number,
so call if you need me.

187
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,285
P.S.  I hope you don't think this is
because I don't have any money.

188
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
- Chairman.
- Let go of me.

189
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,870
You!

190
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,800
I've let you down, chairman.

191
00:23:59,385 --> 00:24:03,318
Please be patient, chairman.
Just like last time, she'll be back when night falls.

192
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,920
Out!

193
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,580
I don't want to see your face.

194
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:08,300
Get out!

195
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,088
Out!

196
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,540
This kid

197
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,130
What if something happen to her?

198
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,400
Good morning, teacher Kim.

199
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,160
Your students did this again?

200
00:25:48,177 --> 00:25:49,582
Are you alright?

201
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,900
that...

202
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,200
- There goes another one.
- Good morning.

203
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:55,200
Teacher Kim bought this car not even 2 days.
They even hit him too.

204
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,577
But he still shouldn't use those pills like that.

205
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,250
This school's Feng Sui is not good.

206
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,305
Three teachers have already quit this semester.

207
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,860
The last teacher was quite good.

208
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,855
That teacher was...

209
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,601
If it wasn't for those weapons,
then he wouldn't have quit.

210
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:19,601
Able to make those type of weapons,
our students are quite intelligent, don't you think?

211
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,500
Teacher Shin

212
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,100
Teacher Jang

213
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,700
- Did you get home safely yesterday?
- What's going on?

214
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:37,102
There is a student on the roof.
I think he's one of your students.

215
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,028
Kim Ren Soo

216
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,400
Before you jump,

217
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:09,517
why don't you admit that you got first place
in this school just because you're lucky.

218
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,470
If not, then how can you be my ribal?

219
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:21,415
You pronounced it wrong. Not B, but V.
Rival.

220
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,400
Ren Soo

221
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,900
What is he saying?

222
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,850
It's so high.  If he looses his balance,
would the head be going down first?

223
00:28:54,951 --> 00:29:00,027
There's a different between suicide and murder.
If his feet land first, then he won't die.

224
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,145
He just wants to copy the other teacher.

225
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,545
Don't you think so?

226
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,660
Teacher Shin

227
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:23,000
Ren Soo, I...

228
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:28,193
I know that it's been hard on you,
but is this the right thing to do?

229
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,770
You're not the only person going through hard times.

230
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:40,210
Regardless of being happy or not, we still need to live.

231
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,800
Teacher

232
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:49,634
You're wearing the same clothes as yesterday.

233
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,616
You also ate lunch by yourself today.

234
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,200
Did any friends call you today?

235
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:02,201
No

236
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,675
How about calling someone that you care for?

237
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:09,887
That, there is someone.

238
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:14,800
Besides 060

239
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,288
No

240
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,150
I knew it.
Why do you want that kind of life?

241
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,278
If we die, we don't even leave behind any dust.

242
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:31,301
What's the point of leaving it behind?

243
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,490
A meaningless life is not a bad thing.

244
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,275
Can you feed on power
and live off your courage?

245
00:30:44,502 --> 00:30:47,547
I know.  You probably feel helpless right now.

246
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,566
And you don't know how to express it.

247
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,800
Courage is very important.
But you can't go any further,

248
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:59,982
because you don't have the courage to.

249
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,132
You then realize of this heavy burden.

250
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:14,383
that you're tired, who can help you?
You asked for help, yet nobody cares.

251
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,990
Live your life to its fullest,
then you can lecture what life is all about.

252
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,325
Let's try to finish this race with all your strength.

253
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,315
Throw away that low self-esteem of yours.

254
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:18,715
What you're telling me is what you saw
in the movie Fly Daddy Fly, isn't it?

255
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,795
Teacher, don't watch too much TV.

256
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:37,034
The reason why you don't have a girlfriend is
because of that 80's image of yours.

257
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,311
- So embarassing.
- Be more cool, teacher.

258
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,500
Teacher, actually I...

259
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,590
Attention!

260
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,875
- Who is supposed to do the cleaning today?
- Chae Moo Shin.

261
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,853
- Where is he?
- We don't know whether he's dead or alive?

262
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,148
I heard yesterday he challenged
Ma Sang's students to a fight.

263
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,317
He's not a martial art fighter,
what is there to challenge?

264
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,592
Ok, since summer arrives early this year

265
00:34:32,595 --> 00:34:35,920
starting next week, you should
get your summer uniforms ready.

266
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:40,660
I mean the weather is changing constantly, so...

267
00:34:40,665 --> 00:34:43,999
- Be careful not to catch a cold.
- Summer?

268
00:34:45,832 --> 00:34:47,485
How boring!

269
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,840
Ok, Class President.

270
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:52,100
Class President.

271
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:57,200
Are you sleeping?

272
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:04,000
Stand up...
Like the soldiers who surrendered to the Japanese.

273
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,320
Do you know that?

274
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,635
Why today's education system has gotten worst and worst?

275
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,000
- There he goes again.  I can't stand it.
- Please make it a quick one.

276
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,256
- I think there's nothing that he doesn't know.

277
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,100
Ren Soo, that guy just talks too much.

278
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,300
He's like that because of the stress.  It's alright.

279
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,811
- Can I have the honor to ask for the class to stand up?
- No need.

280
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,095
There's no need for that kind of respect in my life.

281
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,218
Teacher.

282
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,200
- No, no.
- Listen to what I have to say, then you can go.

283
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,894
I can't.  I'm busy.

284
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,000
Wait, wait.

285
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,100
How are you, teacher?  My students...

286
00:35:57,235 --> 00:36:01,131
- Teacher
- Let's just say... that you said yes.

287
00:36:04,803 --> 00:36:07,106
Thank you!

288
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,660
Did you get home safely yesterday?

289
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,400
Yes, of course.

290
00:36:15,401 --> 00:36:17,513
Did you take that student home?

291
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,990
that...

292
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,600
I'll be going first.

293
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,557
Teacher Shin

294
00:37:00,995 --> 00:37:02,590
Yes

295
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,685
By any chance...

296
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,755
Do you have some free time tonight?

297
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,706
Is there something that you need me to help with?

298
00:37:16,313 --> 00:37:22,136
No, I just want to invite you to dinner.

299
00:37:27,435 --> 00:37:32,303
- Go ahead and answer the phone.
- I really don't have to take this call.

300
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,600
Hello?  Yes, I'm Jang Yi San.

301
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,089
Police station?

302
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So you're telling me that she did this to you?

303
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,856
Yes, we just wanted to talk to her.

304
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,209
You punks.  Did you drink again?

305
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,645
Listen here, have you call home yet?

306
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,375
that...

307
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,600
Teacher

308
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,675
You told him that I'm your teacher?

309
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,550
Didn't you tell me to call you if there's any problem.

310
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,860
Why are you acting like that?

311
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,513
Why haven't you go home yet?

312
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,919
It's not the right time to yet.

313
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,795
Are you afraid that your dad will hit you?

314
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,565
I can't believe you're that innocent.

315
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,348
You really believe what I said?

316
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:06,085
Then, when you said your mom passed away,
that was also...

317
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,400
Hey, how could you lie about that?

318
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,426
Mister, I need some money to get home.
Can you lend me some?

319
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,795
Enough.  I won't believe your lies anymore.

320
00:39:22,223 --> 00:39:23,795
How stingy!

321
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,100
Mister.  Do I look like someone who
won't pay back the money that I borrow?

322
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,840
Who do you think I am?
Calling me whenever you get into trouble.

323
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,680
- You make it like I'm using you.
- Am I wrong?

324
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,500
Alright, I know.

325
00:39:52,501 --> 00:39:55,939
You go your way.
I won't bother you again.

326
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,040
I have to find some money in order to go home.

327
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,803
What?  You want to do it?

328
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:59,190
You ... are really bad.

329
00:41:28,465 --> 00:41:29,899
Teacher Jang

330
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,883
You seems to be tired lately,
did the kids give you a hard time?

331
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,500
No, not really.

332
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:41,075
Is that right?  If that's the case,
can you do me a favor?

333
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,000
Teacher Jang, today is my mother-in-law's birthday.

334
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:51,350
I didn't get to go last year,
if I don't gothis year... then my wife will...

335
00:41:51,351 --> 00:41:55,000
Didn't you say it was your
mother-in-law's funeral last time?

336
00:41:55,001 --> 00:41:57,500
What's wrong with you?
Is my mother-in-law Jesus?

337
00:41:57,501 --> 00:42:01,240
Live and die again.
It's not like I don't want to work.

338
00:42:01,241 --> 00:42:04,800
- Yes, I know.
- Teacher, please help me one more time.

339
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,800
I'll treat you to a great place next time.

340
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,145
- I don't want to.
- Teacher, thank you.

341
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,616
Teacher Jang, thank you!

342
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,216
- Teacher Jang, you're not going home yet?
- No, I have something to take care of...

343
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:30,295
Didn't we make plan for dinner already?
If you can't go, then just us wil be going.

344
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,572
You've worked hard.

345
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,800
Let's go.

346
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,321
All of those men out there
and none of them can find her?

347
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:12,000
Please calm down, chairman.
Your blood pressure.

348
00:43:16,387 --> 00:43:17,800
She's back.

349
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,100
What?

350
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,350
- Miss Yoo!
- You!

351
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,590
Why don't you just live somewhere else?
Why crawl back here?

352
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,485
Father

353
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,805
I have something to tell you.

354
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,000
What's with you now?

355
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,725
Is there something you want now?

356
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:50,973
I'd like to begin studying again.

357
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,146
I've found a school I want to go to.

358
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,695
Teacher Jang.

359
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,706
- Teacher Shin, I thought you've already left.
- I know that you're still here.

360
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,522
You seem to have a hard time
expressing your feelings.

361
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,517
- Where are the other teachers?
-  They went to the karaoke club.

362
00:44:40,518 --> 00:44:45,904
- Why didn't you go with them?
- Because... I can't sing.

363
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:49,660
I'll probably ruin the atmosphere, so...

364
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
this...

365
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,926
You haven't eaten dinner yet, right?

366
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,854
I should go.

367
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,628
See you tomorrow.

368
00:45:21,137 --> 00:45:23,075
that...

369
00:47:17,665 --> 00:47:23,725
Ahjumoni, did you take my stuff
because I didn't pay the rent?

370
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,682
All of my stuff is gone.

371
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:35,871
No, it's not robbery.
Why would they even steal my underwear too?

372
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,450
What?

373
00:47:38,478 --> 00:47:40,880
I'm not drunk.

374
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:48,686
Excuse me.

375
00:47:49,646 --> 00:47:51,499
Are you teacher Jang Yi San?

376
00:47:52,275 --> 00:47:57,950
- Yes, who are you?
- Please come with me.

377
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,183
Follow me inside.
This way, please.

378
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,517
Jang Yi San, MyungMoon High School's teacher.

379
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,191
You graduated from an educational college
last year and started working.

380
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,368
Within a year, you became
a senior homeroom teacher.

381
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,833
Yes, but why did you bring me here?

382
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:06,751
I know that yesterday, my daughter put you out.

383
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:10,944
Excuse me?  Who?

384
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:26,207
Is this student your daughter?

385
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:31,481
You must worry a lot.

386
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,039
Listen

387
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:42,000
I brought you here because I want to
discuss a few things concerning her.

388
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,377
Transfer to my class?

389
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:56,070
Come in.

390
00:51:15,557 --> 00:51:18,945
Excuse me, but did your daughter
get expelled from another school?

391
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,172
I'm putting her in a place closer to your school.

392
00:51:29,803 --> 00:51:36,428
But the way I see it, allowing your daughter
to be alone is like letting a rabid dog...

393
00:51:38,593 --> 00:51:42,617
I mean a puppy off its leash.

394
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,330
Do you think this was
an easy decision for me?

395
00:51:49,331 --> 00:51:52,205
It's not like my daughter and I
have seen eye to eye on everything.

396
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,220
but she said herself that she wants to study.

397
00:51:56,225 --> 00:52:03,209
So I decided to respect
her wishes on this matter.

398
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:08,131
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.  Parents and teachers think alike.

399
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:16,636
So I want you to take care of her
like you would your own daughter.

400
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,235
- Yes.
- So I've already moved your belongings there.

401
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:32,680
So, you're the one who moved my things?

402
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:36,000
Well, if you call a few bags your things.

403
00:52:36,001 --> 00:52:39,500
So you're saying that you want
me to live in the same place as her?

404
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:43,135
Didn't I tell you?
Treat her like your own daughter.

405
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,803
So we'll live...

406
00:52:49,945 --> 00:52:51,361
Live...

407
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,069
together?

408
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,300
Live... together?

409
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,019
A live-in tutor.

410
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,000
I'm not asking for perfect scores.
Just get her a high school diploma.

411
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:23,034
- Help her be at least average.
- Wait a minute.

412
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,065
Sir

413
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,673
I'll pretend I haven't heard anything you've said.

414
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,065
I think, yes...

415
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,162
I'll be going.

416
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,987
I'll give you a million dollars.

417
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,243
How is a million dollars in return for
getting her to graduate high school?

418
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,001
Look, I know you mean well,

419
00:54:02,002 --> 00:54:08,248
but education and money just
do not go hand in hand like that.

420
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,875
Good evening.

421
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,755
That's a pity.  I didn't know
you would respond like this.

422
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,275
Those guys fiddled with it again.
I really could've gotten you.

423
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:25,482
I'm a person who likes to keep things quiet.

424
00:55:25,483 --> 00:55:28,200
Not even your parents can know about this.

425
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:32,994
In the event that my baby girl runs away,

426
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:39,043
or if one finger gets hurt, you're history.

427
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,532
Let's pretend that, one morning.
my daughter says she doesn't like the sound of you breathing.

428
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,600
The moment she calls me about this,

429
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:04,591
that's when you, me, and a shovel
will take a trip to a mountain.

430
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:26,900
Let's go.

431
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,665
If you're thinking about calling the police,
then don't bother.

432
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,800
We know the law quite well.

433
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:46,500
Yes.  Justice is far away, yet violence is right next door.

434
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,240
I believe that you'll be able to help.

435
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,178
The chairman has his own way of doing things,
but if anything happens to miss Yoo...

436
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,596
I won't let you off so easily.

437
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,514
Are you alright?

438
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,119
As you can see.

439
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,185
Mister, you can get up now.

440
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,525
Only care about your own well being.

441
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,300
What did you put in the microwave?

442
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,187
Instant noodles

443
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:38,700
Next time, open the cover before you heat it.

444
00:58:38,704 --> 00:58:40,680
Sometimes I forget to.

445
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:45,215
- I'll go after I clean this up.
- No, no need to.

446
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,796
From now now, we'll do our own cleaning.

447
00:58:52,125 --> 00:58:57,031
I understand.  From now on, I might not
be able to visit you too often.

448
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,195
It's okay.

449
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,825
- You know my number, right?  Anytime...
- Manager Kim.

450
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:23,429
As you can see, there's surveillance cameras in this house.

451
00:59:25,806 --> 00:59:27,716
You know what I mean, right?

452
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,980
Did you say something to your dad
that caused him to misunderstand?

453
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,100
I guess

454
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,571
I just want to tell you that your lies and...

455
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,168
this... I'm truly sorry.

456
01:00:52,932 --> 01:00:56,825
It's my mistake.  I admit that I'm wrong.

457
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:03,442
So, can I go home?

458
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:17,238
Alright.  If it'll make you feel better,
go ahead and hit me.

459
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,300
This is a good solution.  Go ahead.

460
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,984
If that's what you want, then hit me.

461
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:31,283
Even though you are my 19th teacher,

462
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,310
but I hope you'll be the first.

463
01:01:37,315 --> 01:01:38,755
What?

464
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,000
I mean...

465
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:11,158
Let's clean up the mess here first.

466
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,630
Mister, you missed over there.

467
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:18,600
Hey!

468
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,572
Don't call me mister.

469
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,303
Okay

470
01:04:35,311 --> 01:04:36,230
Listen

471
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,272
I know that strength is important in this world,

472
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,462
but you can't just toy with people like this.

473
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,036
Don't misunderstand, because it's
not that I don't want to teach you.

474
01:04:54,800 --> 01:05:00,585
But can't you just clear this up with your dad?

475
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:12,500
Sleeping?

476
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,728
How can you fall asleep so fast?

477
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,618
You thought you'd be safe
after making my daughter sick?

478
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:48,340
I don't know if this is courage or ignorance.

479
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,600
Going somewhere?

480
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,175
Where would I be going?

481
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,176
What's that?

482
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,195
This?

483
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:07,135
I wanted to recycle this.

484
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,000
Why are you cleaning up so late?

485
01:08:12,425 --> 01:08:15,625
What?  You think I was going to run away?

486
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:21,375
Well, if you weren't, then that's great.
I guess I called for nothing.

487
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:26,091
You, did you call your dad to come here?

488
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:32,745
Look here

489
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:39,773
Where would I be going?

490
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,584
All that rustling around.
I thought there was a rat or something.

491
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,510
It's a good thing there isn't.

492
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:30,300
Just say this is the school
and this is where we are,

493
01:09:30,301 --> 01:09:34,000
and we stay together all the way to school,
people might misunderstand.

494
01:09:34,001 --> 01:09:40,157
So we'll separate.
You take the left road, and I'll go right.

495
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:43,432
My route looks longer.

496
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:49,480
Do I look like the kind of person
who would trick a student like that?

497
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:55,267
It's the first rule of business.
Never accept the first offer.

498
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,631
Then what?

499
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,334
I'll go right.

500
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:05,040
You don't know.
This is, this route is safer for you.

501
01:10:05,044 --> 01:10:06,225
Rock, paper, scissors.

502
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:11,545
- Man, you're cheap.
- Scared you're going to lose?

503
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:13,395
Don't regret it.

504
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,617
I'll going to go with scissors.

505
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:24,040
Don't tell me.

506
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,229
I like scissors.

507
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,315
- Hey, stop that.
- Rock, paper, scissors!

508
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:43,892
See you at school, Mr. Jang.

509
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,112
Principal

510
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,200
I have something to tell you.

511
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,100
So, if you accept this transfer student,

512
01:13:32,101 --> 01:13:36,830
the peace of MyungMoon High School
will be put at risk.

513
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:42,830
If our students are quiet hand
grenades with the pins still intact,

514
01:13:42,831 --> 01:13:47,703
Yoo Eun Byul is like a scud missile.

515
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:54,429
I didn't want to do this,

516
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,455
but I'll let you in on a secret.

517
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:04,400
Her father is actually what we
commonly refer to as gangster.

518
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:13,830
Hello, Mr. Jang.

519
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,800
She hit Chae Moo Shin.
