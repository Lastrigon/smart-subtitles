1
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.330
The night before I was heading for Scotland,

2
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
I was invited to host the final

3
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
of "China's Got Talent" show in Shanghai

4
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.330
with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium.

5
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
Guess who was the performing guest?

6
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.330
Susan Boyle.

7
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.330
And I told her, "I'm going to Scotland the next day."

8
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
She sang beautifully,

9
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.330
and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese:

10
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
送你葱

11
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
So it's not like "hello" or "thank you,"

12
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.330
that ordinary stuff.

13
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
It means "green onion for free."

14
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
Why did she say that?

15
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
Because it was a line

16
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.330
from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle --

17
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.330
a 50-some year-old woman,

18
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
a vegetable vendor in Shanghai,

19
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
who loves singing Western opera,

20
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
but she didn't understand

21
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.330
any English or French or Italian,

22
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
so she managed to fill in the lyrics

23
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
with vegetable names in Chinese.

24
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
(Laughter)

25
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma

26
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
that she was singing in the stadium

27
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.330
was "green onion for free."

28
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
So [as] Susan Boyle was saying that,

29
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.330
80,000 live audience sang together.

30
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
That was hilarious.

31
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
So I guess both Susan Boyle

32
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai

33
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
belonged to otherness.

34
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.330
They were the least expected to be successful

35
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
in the business called entertainment,

36
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
yet their courage and talent brought them through.

37
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
And a show and a platform

38
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
gave them the stage

39
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
to realize their dreams.

40
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.330
Well, being different is not that difficult.

41
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
We are all different

42
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
from different perspectives.

43
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
But I think being different is good,

44
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
because you present a different point of view.

45
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.330
You may have the chance to make a difference.

46
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
My generation has been very fortunate

47
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
to witness and participate

48
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.330
in the historic transformation of China

49
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
that has made so many changes

50
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
in the past 20, 30 years.

51
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
I remember that in the year of 1990,

52
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
when I was graduating from college,

53
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
I was applying for a job in the sales department

54
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
of the first five-star hotel in Beijing,

55
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.330
Great Wall Sheraton -- it's still there.

56
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330
So after being interrogated

57
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.330
by this Japanese manager for a half an hour,

58
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.330
he finally said,

59
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
"So, Miss Yang,

60
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
do you have any questions to ask me?"

61
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.330
I summoned my courage and poise and said,

62
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
"Yes, but could you let me know,

63
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.330
what actually do you sell?"

64
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
I didn't have a clue what a sales department was about

65
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
in a five-star hotel.

66
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
That was the first day I set my foot

67
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
in a five-star hotel.

68
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
Around the same time,

69
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
I was going through an audition --

70
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.330
the first ever open audition

71
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.330
by national television in China --

72
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
with another thousand college girls.

73
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
The producer told us

74
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
they were looking for some sweet, innocent

75
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.330
and beautiful fresh face.

76
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
So when it was my turn, I stood up and said,

77
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.330
"Why [do] women's personalities on television

78
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.330
always have to be beautiful, sweet, innocent

79
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
and, you know, supportive?

80
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
Why can't they have their own ideas

81
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
and their own voice?"

82
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.330
I thought I kind of offended them.

83
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.330
But actually, they were impressed by my words.

84
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
And so I was in the second round of competition,

85
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
and then the third and the fourth.

86
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
After seven rounds of competition,

87
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.330
I was the last one to survive it.

88
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.330
So I was on a national television prime-time show.

89
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
And believe it or not,

90
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
that was the first show on Chinese television

91
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
that allowed its hosts

92
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
to speak out of their own minds

93
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.330
without reading an approved script.

94
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.330
(Applause)

95
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.330
And my weekly audience at that time

96
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.330
was between 200 to 300 million people.

97
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
Well after a few years,

98
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.330
I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University

99
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
to pursue my postgraduate studies,

100
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330
and then started my own media company,

101
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
which was unthought of

102
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
during the years that I started my career.

103
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
So we do a lot of things.

104
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.330
I've interviewed more than a thousand people in the past.

105
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.330
And sometimes I have young people approaching me

106
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
say, "Lan, you changed my life,"

107
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
and I feel proud of that.

108
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330
But then we are also so fortunate

109
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.330
to witness the transformation of the whole country.

110
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.330
I was in Beijing's bidding for the Olympic Games.

111
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
I was representing the Shanghai Expo.

112
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
I saw China embracing the world

113
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.330
and vice versa.

114
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
But then sometimes I'm thinking,

115
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.330
what are today's young generation up to?

116
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.330
How are they different,

117
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.330
and what are the differences they are going to make

118
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
to shape the future of China,

119
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
or at large, the world?

120
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
So today I want to talk about young people

121
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
through the platform of social media.

122
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
First of all, who are they? [What] do they look like?

123
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei --

124
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
20 years old, beautiful.

125
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.330
She showed off her expensive bags,

126
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
clothes and car

127
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
on her microblog,

128
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
which is the Chinese version of Twitter.

129
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.330
And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross

130
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
at the Chamber of Commerce.

131
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
She didn't realize

132
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
that she stepped on a sensitive nerve

133
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.330
and aroused national questioning,

134
00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330
almost a turmoil,

135
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.330
against the credibility of Red Cross.

136
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.330
The controversy was so heated

137
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.330
that the Red Cross had to open a press conference

138
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
to clarify it,

139
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
and the investigation is going on.

140
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.330
So far, as of today,

141
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.330
we know that she herself made up that title --

142
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.330
probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity.

143
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
All those expensive items

144
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
were given to her as gifts

145
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
by her boyfriend,

146
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.330
who used to be a board member

147
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.330
in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce.

148
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.330
It's very complicated to explain.

149
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.330
But anyway, the public still doesn't buy it.

150
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
It is still boiling.

151
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330
It shows us a general mistrust

152
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
of government or government-backed institutions,

153
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
which lacked transparency in the past.

154
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.330
And also it showed us

155
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.330
the power and the impact of social media

156
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.330
as microblog.

157
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.330
Microblog boomed in the year of 2010,

158
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.330
with visitors doubled

159
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.330
and time spent on it tripled.

160
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.330
Sina.com, a major news portal,

161
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.330
alone has more than 140 million microbloggers.

162
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.330
On Tencent, 200 million.

163
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
The most popular blogger --

164
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
it's not me --

165
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
it's a movie star,

166
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.330
and she has more than 9.5 million followers, or fans.

167
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.330
About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people,

168
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.330
under 30 years old.

169
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.330
And because, as you know,

170
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government,

171
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.330
social media offers an opening

172
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.330
to let the steam out a little bit.

173
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.330
But because you don't have many other openings,

174
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.330
the heat coming out of this opening

175
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.330
is sometimes very strong, active

176
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.330
and even violent.

177
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.330
So through microblogging,

178
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.330
we are able to understand Chinese youth even better.

179
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
So how are they different?

180
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
First of all, most of them were born

181
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.330
in the 80s and 90s,

182
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
under the one-child policy.

183
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
And because of selected abortion

184
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.330
by families who favored boys to girls,

185
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
now we have ended up

186
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330
with 30 million more young men than women.

187
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.330
That could pose

188
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.330
a potential danger to the society,

189
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.330
but who knows;

190
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.330
we're in a globalized world,

191
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.330
so they can look for girlfriends from other countries.

192
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.330
Most of them have fairly good education.

193
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.330
The illiteracy rate in China among this generation

194
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.330
is under one percent.

195
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.330
In cities, 80 percent of kids go to college.

196
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.330
But they are facing an aging China

197
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.330
with a population above 65 years old

198
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.330
coming up with seven-point-some percent this year,

199
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
and about to be 15 percent

200
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
by the year of 2030.

201
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.330
And you know we have the tradition

202
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
that younger generations support the elders financially,

203
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
and taking care of them when they're sick.

204
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
So it means young couples

205
00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.330
will have to support four parents

206
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.330
who have a life expectancy of 73 years old.

207
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.330
So making a living is not that easy

208
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.330
for young people.

209
00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.330
College graduates are not in short supply.

210
00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
In urban areas,

211
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
college graduates find the starting salary

212
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
is about 400 U.S. dollars a month,

213
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.330
while the average rent

214
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
is above $500.

215
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.330
So what do they do? They have to share space --

216
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
squeezed in very limited space

217
00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
to save money --

218
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330
and they call themselves "tribe of ants."

219
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
And for those who are ready to get married

220
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
and buy their apartment,

221
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
they figured out they have to work

222
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
for 30 to 40 years

223
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.330
to afford their first apartment.

224
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
That ratio in America

225
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.330
would only cost a couple five years to earn,

226
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.330
but in China it's 30 to 40 years

227
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.330
with the skyrocketing real estate price.

228
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.330
Among the 200 million migrant workers,

229
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.330
60 percent of them are young people.

230
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.330
They find themselves sort of sandwiched

231
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.330
between the urban areas and the rural areas.

232
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.330
Most of them don't want to go back to the countryside,

233
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.330
but they don't have the sense of belonging.

234
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
They work for longer hours

235
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.330
with less income, less social welfare.

236
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
And they're more vulnerable

237
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
to job losses,

238
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.330
subject to inflation,

239
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
tightening loans from banks,

240
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
appreciation of the renminbi,

241
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
or decline of demand

242
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.330
from Europe or America

243
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.330
for the products they produce.

244
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.330
Last year, though,

245
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.330
an appalling incident

246
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.330
in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China:

247
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.330
13 young workers

248
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
in their late teens and early 20s

249
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
committed suicide,

250
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.330
just one by one like causing a contagious disease.

251
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.330
But they died because of all different personal reasons.

252
00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.330
But this whole incident

253
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.330
aroused a huge outcry from society

254
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.330
about the isolation,

255
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
both physical and mental,

256
00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.330
of these migrant workers.

257
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.330
For those who do return back to the countryside,

258
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.330
they find themselves very welcome locally,

259
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
because with the knowledge, skills and networks

260
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.330
they have learned in the cities,

261
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
with the assistance of the Internet,

262
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.330
they're able to create more jobs,

263
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.330
upgrade local agriculture and create new business

264
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.330
in the less developed market.

265
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.330
So for the past few years, the coastal areas,

266
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.330
they found themselves in a shortage of labor.

267
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.330
These diagrams show

268
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.330
a more general social background.

269
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.330
The first one is the Engels coefficient,

270
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.330
which explains that the cost of daily necessities

271
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.330
has dropped its percentage

272
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
all through the past decade,

273
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.330
in terms of family income,

274
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.330
to about 37-some percent.

275
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.330
But then in the last two years,

276
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.330
it goes up again to 39 percent,

277
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.330
indicating a rising living cost.

278
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
The Gini coefficient

279
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.330
has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4.

280
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.330
Now it's 0.5 --

281
00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.330
even worse than that in America --

282
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.330
showing us the income inequality.

283
00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.330
And so you see this whole society

284
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.330
getting frustrated

285
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.330
about losing some of its mobility.

286
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.330
And also, the bitterness and even resentment

287
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
towards the rich and the powerful

288
00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.330
is quite widespread.

289
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.330
So any accusations of corruption

290
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.330
or backdoor dealings between authorities or business

291
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.330
would arouse a social outcry

292
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
or even unrest.

293
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.330
So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging,

294
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.330
we can see what young people care most about.

295
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.330
Social justice and government accountability

296
00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.330
runs the first in what they demand.

297
00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.330
For the past decade or so,

298
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.330
a massive urbanization and development

299
00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.330
have let us witness a lot of reports

300
00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.330
on the forced demolition

301
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.330
of private property.

302
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.330
And it has aroused huge anger and frustration

303
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.330
among our young generation.

304
00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.330
Sometimes people get killed,

305
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.330
and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest.

306
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.330
So when these incidents are reported

307
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.330
more and more frequently on the Internet,

308
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.330
people cry for the government to take actions to stop this.

309
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.330
So the good news is that earlier this year,

310
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.330
the state council passed a new regulation

311
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.330
on house requisition and demolition

312
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.330
and passed the right

313
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.330
to order forced demolition from local governments

314
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.330
to the court.

315
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.330
Similarly, many other issues concerning public safety

316
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.330
is a hot topic on the Internet.

317
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.330
We heard about polluted air,

318
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.330
polluted water, poisoned food.

319
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.330
And guess what, we have faked beef.

320
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.330
They have sorts of ingredients

321
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.330
that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish,

322
00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.330
and it turns it to look like beef.

323
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.330
And then lately,

324
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.330
people are very concerned about cooking oil,

325
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.330
because thousands of people have been found

326
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
[refining] cooking oil

327
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.330
from restaurant slop.

328
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.330
So all these things

329
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.330
have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet.

330
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.330
And fortunately,

331
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.330
we have seen the government

332
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.330
responding more timely and also more frequently

333
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.330
to the public concerns.

334
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.330
While young people seem to be very sure

335
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.330
about their participation

336
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
in public policy-making,

337
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
but sometimes they're a little bit lost

338
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.330
in terms of what they want  for their personal life.

339
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.330
China is soon to pass the U.S.

340
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.330
as the number one market

341
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.330
for luxury brands --

342
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.330
that's not including the Chinese expenditures

343
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
in Europe and elsewhere.

344
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.330
But you know what, half of those consumers

345
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.330
are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars.

346
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.330
They're not rich at all.

347
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.330
They're taking those bags and clothes

348
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.330
as a sense of identity and social status.

349
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
And this is a girl explicitly saying

350
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.330
on a TV dating show

351
00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.330
that she would rather cry in a BMW

352
00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.330
than smile on a bicycle.

353
00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.330
But of course, we do have young people

354
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.330
who would still prefer to smile,

355
00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.330
whether in a BMW or [on] a bicycle.

356
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:07.330
So in the next picture, you see a very popular phenomenon

357
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.330
called "naked" wedding, or "naked" marriage.

358
00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.330
It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding,

359
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.330
but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married

360
00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.330
without a house, without a car, without a diamond ring

361
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.330
and without a wedding banquet,

362
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.330
to show their commitment to true love.

363
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.330
And also, people are doing good through social media.

364
00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
And the first picture showed us

365
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.330
that a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs

366
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.330
for food processing

367
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.330
was spotted and stopped on the highway

368
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.330
with the whole country watching

369
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.330
through microblogging.

370
00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.330
People were donating money, dog food

371
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.330
and offering volunteer work to stop that truck.

372
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.330
And after hours of negotiation,

373
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.330
500 dogs were rescued.

374
00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:56.330
And here also people are helping to find missing children.

375
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.330
A father posted his son's picture onto the Internet.

376
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.330
After thousands of resends in relay,

377
00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.330
the child was found,

378
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.330
and we witnessed the reunion of the family

379
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.330
through microblogging.

380
00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.330
So happiness is the most popular word

381
00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.330
we have heard through the past two years.

382
00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.330
Happiness is not only related

383
00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.330
to personal experiences and personal values,

384
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.330
but also, it's about the environment.

385
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.330
People are thinking about the following questions:

386
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.330
Are we going to sacrifice our environment further

387
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.330
to produce higher GDP?

388
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.330
How are we going to perform our social and political reform

389
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.330
to keep pace with economic growth,

390
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.330
to keep sustainability and stability?

391
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.330
And also, how capable is the system

392
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.330
of self-correctness

393
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.330
to keep more people content

394
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.330
with all sorts of friction going on at the same time?

395
00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.330
I guess these are the questions people are going to answer.

396
00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.330
And our younger generation

397
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.330
are going to transform this country

398
00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:02.330
while at the same time being transformed themselves.

399
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.330
Thank you very much.

400
00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:14.330
