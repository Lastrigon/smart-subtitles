1
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:48,987
I will tell you something about my grandpa and grandma.

2
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:55,994
It is still being refered nowadays in my hometown.

3
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,999
Someone beliefs and others do not belief as time goes by.

4
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:16,025
This is my grandma.

5
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:21,019
She was married in July 9th that year.

6
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:26,024
Her husband was a shopkepper in Shibali Po called Big Head Lee.

7
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:31,040
He was not married untill over 50 years old.

8
00:01:31,074 --> 00:01:36,034
Because everyone knew that he was a lazar.

9
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:45,043
It is said that: when you are crying on a sedan,  you are not safe in the future.

10
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:52,050
If you lift the cloth on your head,  you are in trouble.

11
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:58,056
Get into the sedan!

12
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:16,085
As usual.

13
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:21,079
Someone will play tricks on bride on the road.

14
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:28,086
The people carried sedan and trumpeted were Big Head Lee's worker.

15
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:33,091
There was only one clergyman employed.

16
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:36,105
He was quite famous in my hometown.

17
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:41,099
He bacame my grandpa later.

18
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:28,157
Bride on sedan, do not keek.

19
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:31,160
talk with us.

20
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:34,163
It is boring in the sedan.

21
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:39,157
It is said that: When you are boring,  talk with someone; When you are in trouble,  sing a song.

22
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:40,169
I can teach you.

23
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:45,163
Keeking is no use now.

24
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:49,178
It is not easy for us to carry you once.

25
00:03:49,212 --> 00:03:54,172
Yes, not easy.

26
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:59,177
Whose daughter is it?  What a pity.

27
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:03,181
Her parents are so cruelhearted.  They only take money into account.

28
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:04,193
She will be painful in the future.

29
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:07,196
His parents only think about money. . . .

30
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,199
Big Head Lee is badly illed.

31
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,201
He will never recover.

32
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:15,204
Yes, he will never recover.

33
00:04:15,238 --> 00:04:20,198
You can not live with Big Head Lee.

34
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:22,211
Or you will be badly illed.

35
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:24,213
Yes,  badly illed.

36
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:27,216
If you regret now,  we will carry you back.

37
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,209
You say one word,  and we will carry you back.

38
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:34,223
We are waiting for you.

39
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:39,217
Sing a song, Please.

40
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:49,227
Silence?  we will make you say something.

41
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:55,233
Tuba.

42
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:19,257
(Folk song)

43
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:08,426
Go!

44
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:33,451
From my grandma's home to Shibali Po,  It will pass QingShaKou.

45
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:40,458
No one knows from when QingShaKou is full of sorghum.

46
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:46,464
No one plant and no one harvest.

47
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:50,468
They all say that these are wild sorghum.

48
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:55,473
And is often haunted.

49
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:26,515
Stop.

50
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:30,508
Do not run.

51
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:35,513
Lay the sedan down.

52
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:46,524
Money!

53
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:48,537
I am bald and erevyone call me "Special bald with gun".

54
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:53,531
Money or I will shoot!

55
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:09,547
Uncoil belt.

56
00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:15,553
Bring the money and belt here.

57
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:33,571
All go behind the sedan.

58
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:39,577
Do not look back.

59
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:47,585
Squat.

60
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:19,617
Do not look back or I will shoot.

61
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,669
Get off and go.

62
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:05,663
Go to the sorghum field.

63
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:34,692
Go quickly!

64
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:03,721
No look!Go!

65
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:17,735
Beat!Beat here!

66
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,740
Beat!Beat!

67
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:31,749
He is so weak. He is dead.

68
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:36,765
He is not bald. He has hair.

69
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,767
The gun is bogus too.

70
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:43,761
He is bodacious indeed.

71
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:57,775
Tuba is yours.

72
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:06,844
There are not many people living in Shibali Po.

73
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:10,848
And the shopkepeer is a lazar.

74
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:15,853
People seldom come here except those who buy alcohol.

75
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:44,001
It is conventional to bring the bride back in my hometown.

76
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:49,006
That day, My grandgrandpa took her back home.

77
00:17:55,057 --> 00:18:00,017
You must come back,  dear,  back to Lee's family.

78
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:04,032
How luxury!

79
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:07,035
They give us a mule without thinking.

80
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:11,028
Though you are not willing.

81
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:15,032
Dont't throw the scissor.

82
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:20,037
You should be back and come back to the family Lee.

83
00:18:23,085 --> 00:18:28,045
Daughter,  why are you in such a hurry?

84
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:26,283
Daughter,  it has been really a long time since you went to pee.

85
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:32,289
How did you pee?

86
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:49,306
Girl,  go and just go bravely.

87
00:22:50,352 --> 00:22:55,312
Go forward and do not look back.

88
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:02,319
There are thousands of ways to the heaven.

89
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:09,326
Thousands of. . .

90
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:21,338
Girl,  go and just go bravely.

91
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:27,344
Go forward and do not look back.

92
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,359
From now on you. . .

93
00:23:31,393 --> 00:23:35,352
. . . throw away the red embroidery ball.

94
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:39,356
What a big  red embroidery ball.

95
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:44,361
It just hits on my head.

96
00:23:44,406 --> 00:23:48,365
Let's have a drink.

97
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,369
The red jowar alcohol.

98
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:57,374
The red jowar alcohol.

99
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:03,380
Actor,  get out!

100
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:07,384
You gay man!

101
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:12,389
What a rubbish tune you are singing.

102
00:24:15,437 --> 00:24:20,397
Girl,  go and just go bravely.

103
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:25,402
Go forward and do not look back.

104
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:48,425
What are you doing?  You don't have dinner and want to be god?

105
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:53,430
You have such a good luck,  but you cannot get awared of that.

106
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:58,435
Look at the family Lee,  they give us a big black emule.

107
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,439
Go back and enjoy your life.

108
00:25:02,484 --> 00:25:07,444
Look to the future,  all the fortune of the family Lee will belong to you.

109
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:11,448
What are people living for?

110
00:25:11,493 --> 00:25:14,462
Since you've married,  you will become the member of the family Lee without any doubt.

111
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:19,456
Be quick,  finish the dinner and go back.

112
00:25:23,505 --> 00:25:28,465
I'll go,  I will.

113
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:35,472
You are not my dad,  and I don't have a dad like you.

114
00:25:35,517 --> 00:25:40,477
You just want me to exchange for a big black emule,  and you go and live with it.

115
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:47,484
I will go,  I will,  and I will never come back.

116
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:52,489
Bitch,  it's not such an easy thing.

117
00:25:52,534 --> 00:25:57,494
I and your mom get you born,  and is it easy for us?

118
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:02,499
When my granni was shouting at her dad,  something happened at Shibali Po.

119
00:26:02,544 --> 00:26:06,503
Big head-Lee was killed.

120
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:10,507
No one knew who had done that.

121
00:26:10,552 --> 00:26:15,512
But I always think that it was my grandpa.

122
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:20,517
But until he passed away I have kept this.

123
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:27,524
Da Zhuang and Er zhuang,  let's go and we can live anywhere.

124
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:30,538
This lepra place,  bad luck.

125
00:26:30,572 --> 00:26:33,541
After this woman is married bad things begin to appear.

126
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:38,535
This is really evil,  so quiet.

127
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:43,540
The boss disappeared again,  and all the doors are locked.

128
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:46,554
This pan is still on the kang.

129
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:51,548
I heard that one shoe is found under the Qing Sha Bridge.

130
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:55,563
He may be killed.

131
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:59,556
Talk of the Qing Sha Bridge,  it will be not easy.

132
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:04,561
Several people of county came two days ago,  and they searched for three days,  but nothing was found.

133
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:10,567
Who did this?

134
00:27:10,612 --> 00:27:15,572
This old man is a bad guy and it must be someone to revenge.

135
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:20,577
You see,  the killer didn't crack the trunks and doors.

136
00:27:20,622 --> 00:27:24,581
He just wanted him dead.

137
00:27:24,626 --> 00:27:29,586
This woman is not a good person either,  and she always makes some trouble.

138
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:35,592
From the day when she came,  she began to flirt with the muscle man.

139
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,600
Hey,  don't think too much,  we should pack our stuff and go tomorrow.

140
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:44,612
Don't make any trouble.

141
00:27:44,646 --> 00:27:46,614
I'm in.

142
00:27:46,648 --> 00:27:48,616
Come in.

143
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,618
I haven't got my pants on.

144
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:53,621
Er Dengzi's dad,  why are you still drinking?

145
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:55,623
Hey,  you again.

146
00:27:55,657 --> 00:27:59,616
Go back to home and sleep.

147
00:27:59,661 --> 00:28:03,620
I saw that woman sit in the courtyard alone just now.

148
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:05,633
It's awfully dark.

149
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:08,636
Oh,  ask her to move here.

150
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:13,630
Are you going nuts?

151
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:48,665
She's afraid to be in the house and get sick,  poor woman.

152
00:29:09,731 --> 00:29:11,699
Boss?

153
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:16,693
Boss?

154
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:55,732
This jowar alcohol can cure all the illness.

155
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:24,772
Please don't leave.

156
00:30:24,806 --> 00:30:29,766
I want to say something,  our rack boiler cannot disband.

157
00:30:29,811 --> 00:30:34,771
Brother Arhat.

158
00:30:34,816 --> 00:30:37,785
Brother Arhat,  how long have you been in the family Lee?

159
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:42,779
All the things will depend on you.

160
00:30:42,824 --> 00:30:47,784
I,  a woman,  just depend on everyone.

161
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:55,792
If there is still someone who don't want to stay,  I won't keep you here.

162
00:30:56,838 --> 00:30:58,806
The hire of this month will be paid as usual.

163
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,800
If you still want to come back later,  you are still our man in the rack boiler.

164
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:09,806
I think all of you stay.

165
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:14,811
Everyone will share the profit.

166
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:20,817
Is that OK?

167
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:22,830
OK,  all stay.

168
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:23,831
Yes,  stay and won't leave any more.

169
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:24,832
listen to him.

170
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:25,833
Let's stay here.

171
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:30,827
Don't call me boss,  I'm also born of a poor family.

172
00:31:30,872 --> 00:31:32,840
We're all fair here.

173
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:37,834
I rank 9 at home,  born at Sep. 9th.

174
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:44,841
People call me Jiu-er,  and you too.

175
00:31:46,888 --> 00:31:49,857
Jiu-er.

176
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:52,860
Jiu-er.

177
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:57,854
Shall we tidy up the courtyard?

178
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:02,859
We're afraid of the virus here.  Let's do a sweepup.

179
00:32:03,905 --> 00:32:07,864
From now on,  uou are the boss,  tell us what to do.

180
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:09,877
Yes,  tell us.

181
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:13,870
We'll obey your order,  Jiu-er.

182
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:18,875
Well,  stop the fire for 2 days.

183
00:32:19,921 --> 00:32:21,889
You sweep the house for me.

184
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:26,883
Burn everything that the elder boss ever used,  or bury them.

185
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:32,889
Luo Han,  buy some whitewash to wash the whole backyard.

186
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:37,894
Then sprinkle the kaoliang spirit here three times.

187
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,899
Didn't you say that the kaoliang spirit could treat any disease?

188
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:47,904
Today we'll use it to disinfect the atomsphere here.

189
00:33:00,962 --> 00:33:03,931
I have disinfected the key with wine three times.

190
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:08,925
Mine is yours,  keep it.

191
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:53,970
It was in the kaoliang filed.

192
00:34:03,024 --> 00:34:07,984
I can walk by myself,  I can.

193
00:34:11,032 --> 00:34:13,000
You must have forgot.

194
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:15,002
I haven't catch the words.

195
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:19,996
Then what happened after that?

196
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:26,002
I pulled down the kaoliang,  then she lay down.

197
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:30,006
Once she lay down,  I got the signal.

198
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:35,011
You guys,  don't accost with him anymore.

199
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:39,015
Yes,  let's go out.

200
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:43,019
Go out,  it's near my house.

201
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:46,033
Here. . . Go the house there.

202
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:48,035
I'll sleep here.

203
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:52,028
From now on,  I'll sleep here.

204
00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:54,041
This is mine,  that's our boss's.

205
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:59,035
The boss?  Who's the fuck boss?
What are you saying?  Big head-Lee

206
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:05,041
Who is fucking big head-Lee?

207
00:35:05,086 --> 00:35:08,055
I won't	fear even if he was alive.

208
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:12,048
I tell you,  she's my woman.

209
00:35:12,093 --> 00:35:15,062
Mine.

210
00:35:15,096 --> 00:35:18,065
She loves me.

211
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:23,059
She said she love me stealthily.

212
00:35:35,116 --> 00:35:40,076
Didn't you?

213
00:35:51,132 --> 00:35:56,092
She is pretended,  she want me come in.

214
00:36:06,147 --> 00:36:11,107
Go back.

215
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:19,115
Go back.

216
00:36:37,178 --> 00:36:42,138
He's drunk,  pull him out.

217
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:08,175
Press him down.
I'll sleep.

218
00:37:08,209 --> 00:37:11,178
Hold him.

219
00:37:11,212 --> 00:37:15,171
You fuck woman.

220
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:18,185
How can you disavow our relationship?

221
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:23,179
I'm sleepy,  I wanna go to bed.

222
00:37:27,228 --> 00:37:32,188
Shut the fuck up.

223
00:37:34,235 --> 00:37:39,195
So comfort.

224
00:37:47,248 --> 00:37:51,207
Let him down,  boss.

225
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:56,212
Go away,  quick.

226
00:37:56,257 --> 00:38:01,217
I haven't finished.  I. . .

227
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:11,227
I can't go.

228
00:38:37,298 --> 00:38:42,258
I didn't know you,  throw him into the crock.

229
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:54,270
get his baggage.

230
00:39:02,323 --> 00:39:07,283
Don't cover.

231
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:13,289
Let me out.

232
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:21,297
The robber coming.

233
00:39:45,366 --> 00:39:50,326
Have big head-Lee go to bed with you?

234
00:39:50,371 --> 00:39:53,340
Yes.

235
00:39:53,374 --> 00:39:58,334
Fuck.

236
00:40:01,382 --> 00:40:06,342
Go ahead,  don't look back.

237
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:15,351
My grandfather lay in the crock for 3 days.

238
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:22,358
Pu san pao robbed my grandmother and leave a message.

239
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:25,372
He ask them atone for her with money.

240
00:40:25,406 --> 00:40:30,366
Or they could only see the death.

241
00:40:32,413 --> 00:40:34,381
Jiu-er is back.

242
00:40:34,415 --> 00:40:39,375
Who?

243
00:40:43,424 --> 00:40:45,392
Luo han,  you are back.

244
00:40:45,426 --> 00:40:50,386
Jiu-er.

245
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:45,441
Gimme some wine.

246
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:57,453
Is there anyone?

247
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:21,488
What do you have to go with wine?

248
00:42:21,522 --> 00:42:23,490
Bull head.

249
00:42:23,524 --> 00:42:25,492
I wanna eat beef.

250
00:42:25,526 --> 00:42:30,486
I want bull head.

251
00:42:30,531 --> 00:42:35,491
Well,  the fuck bull head.

252
00:42:46,547 --> 00:42:48,515
I want beef.

253
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:50,517
Eat or scram.

254
00:42:50,551 --> 00:42:53,520
How dare you abuse me?

255
00:42:53,554 --> 00:42:56,523
I want the beef.

256
00:42:56,557 --> 00:43:01,517
Sit there youself.

257
00:43:02,563 --> 00:43:07,523
Beef is for San pao.

258
00:43:32,593 --> 00:43:35,562
One dollar.

259
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:39,555
But i have only 3 cents.

260
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,567
1 dollar.

261
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:44,560
Grandpa had only 3 cents.

262
00:43:44,605 --> 00:43:47,574
Son, you come here to steal food?

263
00:43:47,608 --> 00:43:48,575
Forget it if you don't want.

264
00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:50,577
Hold it.

265
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:53,580
Hold it.   What?

266
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:57,573
What?  Luo.

267
00:43:57,618 --> 00:44:02,578
Boss,  he's here to steal food.

268
00:44:02,623 --> 00:44:07,583
Cut off his tongue.

269
00:44:23,644 --> 00:44:27,603
Oh,  I was drunk,  I was drunk.

270
00:44:27,648 --> 00:44:29,616
I was just kidding.

271
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:34,610
OK,  then keep your tongue,  so you can kiss the women.

272
00:44:35,656 --> 00:44:40,616
Go to kotow to our boss.

273
00:44:41,662 --> 00:44:42,629
Will you do it or not?

274
00:44:42,663 --> 00:44:47,623
Go, go, go.

275
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:52,639
On your knees!

276
00:44:52,673 --> 00:44:57,633
How dare you! Make trouble here.

277
00:44:57,678 --> 00:45:00,647
Come on, let's drink more.

278
00:45:00,681 --> 00:45:04,640
Shisan Ye, forgive me,  please forgive me.

279
00:45:04,685 --> 00:45:06,653
I was blind, I shouldn't offend you

280
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,656
I was drunk and kidding just now

281
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:13,649
I won't do it again, I won't

282
00:45:13,694 --> 00:45:15,662
Don't move, I will kill whoever moves

283
00:45:15,696 --> 00:45:16,663
Don't move

284
00:45:16,697 --> 00:45:19,666
Don't move

285
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,668
Brother, I am not your enemy

286
00:45:21,702 --> 00:45:23,670
You've destroyed my girl

287
00:45:23,704 --> 00:45:26,673
Your girl?

288
00:45:26,707 --> 00:45:28,675
The girl in the brewhouse?

289
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:29,676
Yes, you've destroyed her.

290
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:32,679
I haven't, I was just for the 3, 000 dollars

291
00:45:32,713 --> 00:45:34,681
Bullshit

292
00:45:34,715 --> 00:45:39,675
No, I won't touch the girls from Mafeng Dong

293
00:45:42,723 --> 00:45:47,683
Man, if you don't believe it

294
00:45:47,728 --> 00:45:52,688
cut off my head

295
00:45:53,734 --> 00:45:58,694
Hold it

296
00:46:07,748 --> 00:46:12,708
Boss, he's not in our party, let's kill him

297
00:46:15,756 --> 00:46:20,716
It's a shame for my shop to let such a guy die here

298
00:46:23,764 --> 00:46:28,724
Hey, walk to the door, do you scare of death?

299
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:43,739
Pu Sanpao, you are so mean, I didn't kill you just now

300
00:46:44,785 --> 00:46:49,745
Now you play fucking tricks on me

301
00:47:10,811 --> 00:47:15,771
Thanks to Brother Luo-han these days

302
00:47:15,816 --> 00:47:20,776
He was taking care of this

303
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:25,781
He came back safely at last

304
00:47:26,827 --> 00:47:31,787
Boss, is everything okay now?

305
00:47:34,835 --> 00:47:39,795
It's Spetember 9th today, let's make the fire as usual

306
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:45,801
Won't you go and take a look?  Take a walk and calm down

307
00:47:54,855 --> 00:47:59,815
Fine, I've been here for some days but haven't went there.

308
00:48:06,867 --> 00:48:11,827
Brother Luo-han, don't call me Boss from now on, only you call me boss

309
00:48:12,873 --> 00:48:17,833
Yes, boss

310
00:48:18,879 --> 00:48:23,839
Guys, the boss is coming, cover it up.

311
00:48:23,884 --> 00:48:25,852
Don't we know each other, huh?

312
00:48:25,886 --> 00:48:30,846
No, honey, have you dressed up?

313
00:48:47,908 --> 00:48:50,877
Da-hao, how's the water now?

314
00:48:50,911 --> 00:48:52,879
Not ready yet

315
00:48:52,913 --> 00:48:54,881
Look at it, Da-hao, get me the pots

316
00:48:54,915 --> 00:48:57,884
It's distiling, the steam of alcohol comes down up there.

317
00:48:57,918 --> 00:49:01,877
The wine flows down when the steam meet the cold water

318
00:49:01,922 --> 00:49:04,891
Da-chu, Er-chu, let me have a try

319
00:49:04,925 --> 00:49:09,885
OK, you try it

320
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:14,890
So heavy

321
00:49:21,942 --> 00:49:26,902
Jiu-er, sit down

322
00:49:27,948 --> 00:49:31,907
I have to get to know how does the shorgum become the wine today

323
00:49:31,952 --> 00:49:33,920
Cold water

324
00:49:33,954 --> 00:49:38,914
Here comes the cold water

325
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,920
Make the fire hotter!

326
00:49:45,966 --> 00:49:47,934
Get me some cold water

327
00:49:47,968 --> 00:49:52,928
Here it comes

328
00:49:53,974 --> 00:49:58,934
Fire it up!

329
00:50:32,012 --> 00:50:36,972
Go to pour the wine

330
00:50:46,026 --> 00:50:50,986
To the God of wine

331
00:51:08,048 --> 00:51:13,008
The best wine is made by us in September

332
00:51:15,055 --> 00:51:19,014
The best wine

333
00:51:19,059 --> 00:51:22,028
If you've drunk our wine

334
00:51:22,062 --> 00:51:27,022
you won't cough

335
00:51:28,068 --> 00:51:31,037
If you've drunk our wine

336
00:51:31,071 --> 00:51:36,031
you'll be strong

337
00:51:36,076 --> 00:51:38,044
If you've drunk our wine

338
00:51:38,078 --> 00:51:43,038
You will scare of nothing

339
00:51:44,084 --> 00:51:46,052
If you've drunk our wine

340
00:51:46,086 --> 00:51:51,046
You won't kotow even when you see the emperor

341
00:51:51,091 --> 00:51:56,051
Just follow me

342
00:52:01,101 --> 00:52:06,061
Nice wine

343
00:52:22,122 --> 00:52:27,082
Boss, let me try your new kind of wine

344
00:52:28,128 --> 00:52:29,095
Drink a bowl of this kind of wine

345
00:52:29,129 --> 00:52:34,089
Come on, drink it all

346
00:52:34,134 --> 00:52:39,094
Jiu-er, drink it

347
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:04,119
Come on, drink it

348
00:53:04,164 --> 00:53:08,123
Drink it all

349
00:53:08,168 --> 00:53:10,136
Jiu-er, you are so good at drinking!

350
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:12,138
No, I can't drink

351
00:53:12,172 --> 00:53:16,131
If you practise more, you can drink a pot of wine

352
00:53:16,176 --> 00:53:21,136
I'm not like you

353
00:53:22,182 --> 00:53:27,142
Aye, good.

354
00:53:29,189 --> 00:53:32,158
So good

355
00:53:32,192 --> 00:53:35,161
Good

356
00:53:35,195 --> 00:53:39,154
Brother, come here

357
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:44,159
It feels so good

358
00:53:44,204 --> 00:53:49,164
Drink a bowl of this kind of wine

359
00:54:41,261 --> 00:54:44,230
Hey, what are you doing?

360
00:54:44,264 --> 00:54:49,224
Look, let me make you some wine

361
00:58:49,509 --> 00:58:54,469
My grandpa pissed in the pots, it meant to be a hotfoot

362
00:58:56,516 --> 00:59:01,476
But it was so strange that the wine in those pots became better

363
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:16,491
Boss. . . . . congratulations

364
00:59:17,537 --> 00:59:22,497
Boss. . . . . . . . . congratulations

365
00:59:27,547 --> 00:59:32,507
Yo, Brother Luo-han, thanks!

366
00:59:37,557 --> 00:59:42,517
Boss. . . . . . . . . congratulations

367
00:59:42,562 --> 00:59:46,521
The wine is perfect, I've spent over 10 years beside the boiler,

368
00:59:46,566 --> 00:59:51,526
but I've never seen such good wine

369
00:59:52,572 --> 00:59:56,531
Boss, give this kind of wine a name please

370
00:59:56,576 --> 01:00:01,536
A man needs a name, so does the wine

371
01:00:06,586 --> 01:00:11,546
It's "Shibali Po" here, so call the wine "Shibali Hong"

372
01:00:15,595 --> 01:00:20,555
Jiu-er, I put the "Shibali Hong" in the doorway

373
01:00:27,607 --> 01:00:32,567
My Grandpa Luo-han went away in that night

374
01:00:34,614 --> 01:00:39,574
9 years has passed, Our "Shibali Hong" became very famous

375
01:00:39,619 --> 01:00:42,588
My dad was 9 years old then

376
01:00:42,622 --> 01:00:47,582
People said my dad was a bastard from the sorghum field

377
01:00:47,627 --> 01:00:52,587
Once, the 99-year-old Grandma Wang in my hometown told me

378
01:00:53,633 --> 01:00:58,593
9 of 10 bastards are assholes

379
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:35,630
Mom

380
01:01:43,683 --> 01:01:48,643
Mom

381
01:02:43,743 --> 01:02:45,711
Brother Luo-han

382
01:02:45,745 --> 01:02:50,705
Brother Luo-han!

383
01:03:43,803 --> 01:03:48,763
It's Brother Luo-han

384
01:03:57,817 --> 01:04:00,786
The japs came

385
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:05,780
In July of that year, The japs came to build the railway

386
01:07:25,024 --> 01:07:27,993
Good work

387
01:07:28,027 --> 01:07:31,986
You are flattering me

388
01:07:32,031 --> 01:07:33,999
The officer says you did it well

389
01:07:34,033 --> 01:07:37,992
That's what I should do.

390
01:07:38,037 --> 01:07:42,997
The officer says 1 is not enough, he want 1 more

391
01:07:43,042 --> 01:07:45,010
OK. . . . .

392
01:07:45,044 --> 01:07:50,004
Look

393
01:07:54,053 --> 01:07:59,013
You see him?  Go to kill him

394
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:04,029
Sir, you are kidding

395
01:08:04,063 --> 01:08:09,023
I mean it, go to kill him

396
01:08:09,068 --> 01:08:12,037
Hurry up!

397
01:08:12,071 --> 01:08:14,039
Why are you still standing here?  Go!

398
01:08:14,073 --> 01:08:16,041
i can't, sir

399
01:08:16,075 --> 01:08:21,035
I can't. . . . . Sir, please forgive me

400
01:08:23,082 --> 01:08:28,042
The officer said, if you don't do it well, he will kill you

401
01:08:32,091 --> 01:08:36,050
Listen!

402
01:08:36,095 --> 01:08:40,054
Your sorghum is step on too

403
01:08:40,099 --> 01:08:45,059
Now. . . . let me show you all something!

404
01:08:47,106 --> 01:08:52,066
The man hung up there. . . . . look at him

405
01:08:58,117 --> 01:09:03,077
If anyone do something against us, he'll be like him

406
01:09:56,175 --> 01:10:01,135
You. . . . . kill me. . . . let me die

407
01:10:02,181 --> 01:10:06,140
I won't forget it even I die. . . .

408
01:10:06,185 --> 01:10:09,154
What are you waiting for?

409
01:10:09,188 --> 01:10:14,148
Sir, the cold water may help

410
01:10:14,193 --> 01:10:17,162
You are so good at it

411
01:10:17,196 --> 01:10:22,156
Boss, you can't survive this time

412
01:10:22,201 --> 01:10:27,161
I don't want it

413
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:34,168
Come on, hurry!

414
01:10:54,233 --> 01:10:58,192
Bastard!

415
01:10:58,237 --> 01:11:00,205
Bastard of the japs

416
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:03,208
Don't fall out

417
01:11:03,242 --> 01:11:05,210
Bastard!

418
01:11:05,244 --> 01:11:10,204

419
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:16,210

01:11:49,288 --> 01:11:54,248

423
01:11:55,294 --> 01:11:59,253

01:11:59,298 --> 01:12:02,267

425
01:12:02,301 --> 01:12:07,261
You must kill him, get it?

426
01:12:07,306 --> 01:12:12,266
Forgive you?  If you don't kill him today, you'll be killed.

427
01:12:15,314 --> 01:12:20,274
The officer said if you don't kill him today, you'll be killed, do you get it?

428
01:12:23,322 --> 01:12:28,282
Hurry up!

429
01:12:30,329 --> 01:12:33,298
Luo-han, Brother Luo-han.

430
01:12:33,332 --> 01:12:38,292
Please forgive me.

431
01:12:42,341 --> 01:12:47,301
Be uncomplaining, Brother Luo-han, be uncomplaining.

432
01:12:48,347 --> 01:12:53,307
Brother, just be uncomplaining

433
01:13:10,369 --> 01:13:15,329
Hurry up

434
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:21,335
Do it

435
01:13:32,391 --> 01:13:37,351
People in my hometown said, my grandpa Luo-han joined Communism Party

436
01:13:38,397 --> 01:13:43,357
He recruited the local force on demand to fight against the japs

437
01:13:44,403 --> 01:13:49,363
I've checked the county annals, it's said,

438
01:13:49,408 --> 01:13:54,368
The japs forced over 400, 000 farmers to build the "Chang Ping Railway"

439
01:13:56,415 --> 01:14:01,375
Many families was destroyed, over 1, 000 people was killed

440
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:06,380
Luo-han Liu was killed in public in Ching Sha Kou

441
01:14:08,427 --> 01:14:13,387
He wasn't scared, scolded the japs until he died

442
01:15:39,518 --> 01:15:44,478
Dou-guan, kneel down

443
01:15:49,528 --> 01:15:54,488
It's the "Shibali Hong" made by your Uncle Luo-han, kotow

444
01:15:57,536 --> 01:16:02,496
Drink it

445
01:16:30,569 --> 01:16:35,529
Drink it if you are a man

446
01:17:24,623 --> 01:17:29,583
We are going to screw the japs' cars, as the revenge for Brother Luo-han

447
01:18:05,664 --> 01:18:10,624
The best wine is made by us in September

448
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:14,639
the best wine

449
01:18:14,673 --> 01:18:18,632
If you've drunk our wine

450
01:18:18,677 --> 01:18:23,637
you won't cough

451
01:18:23,682 --> 01:18:26,651
If you've drunk our wine

452
01:18:26,685 --> 01:18:31,645
You will be strong

453
01:18:32,691 --> 01:18:35,660
If you've drunk our wine

454
01:18:35,694 --> 01:18:40,654
You will scare of nothing

455
01:18:40,699 --> 01:18:42,667
If you've drunk our wine

456
01:18:42,701 --> 01:18:47,661
You won't kotow even when you see the emperor

457
01:18:48,707 --> 01:18:53,667
Just follow me

458
01:18:58,717 --> 01:19:03,677
Good wine, the wine is perfect

459
01:20:09,788 --> 01:20:12,757
Dou-guan, come here

460
01:20:12,791 --> 01:20:17,751
What's up?

461
01:20:17,796 --> 01:20:20,765
Piss

462
01:20:20,799 --> 01:20:25,759
Da-hao, you trump later when the fight starts

463
01:20:26,805 --> 01:20:29,774
I can only trump some easy songs

464
01:20:29,808 --> 01:20:31,776
Which song should I trump later?

465
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:36,770
Just trump something, the japs will be scared

466
01:20:36,815 --> 01:20:41,775
You trump as loud as you can later, the louder the better

467
01:21:17,856 --> 01:21:21,815
Hey, the car is coming. . . . . . . .

468
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:26,820
Wake up, check your gun

469
01:21:32,871 --> 01:21:37,831
I filled twice amount of powder, it will work

470
01:22:02,901 --> 01:22:04,869
My dad told me

471
01:22:04,903 --> 01:22:09,863
His eyes have got the disease since he saw the sun that day

472
01:22:09,908 --> 01:22:14,868
everything was red in his eyes

473
01:22:17,916 --> 01:22:19,884
I came back to the hometown that year

474
01:22:19,918 --> 01:22:24,878
The bridge was still there in Ching Sha Kou, but all the shorghum gone.

475
01:23:24,983 --> 01:23:29,943
Mom

476
01:23:33,992 --> 01:23:35,960
Is the fight over?

477
01:23:35,994 --> 01:23:38,963
Not yet

478
01:23:38,997 --> 01:23:40,965
Then where is your dad?

479
01:23:40,999 --> 01:23:45,959
I'm goning to sleep up there, I'm hungry

480
01:24:09,027 --> 01:24:13,987
Mom

481
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:47,020
Mom

482
01:24:49,067 --> 01:24:52,036
Honey

483
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:56,029
Mom

484
01:24:56,074 --> 01:25:01,034
Shoot it, shoot it

485
01:25:01,079 --> 01:25:06,039
Brother

486
01:25:10,088 --> 01:25:15,048
Come on

487
01:25:47,125 --> 01:25:52,085
Dad

488
01:26:31,169 --> 01:26:36,129
Dad

489
01:26:39,177 --> 01:26:44,137
Dad

490
01:28:09,267 --> 01:28:14,227
Dad, look

491
01:28:37,295 --> 01:28:42,255
Mom, Mom, go southwestwards

492
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:47,260
The roads are wide and the ships are long

493
01:28:47,305 --> 01:28:52,265
Mom, Mom, go southwestwards

494
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:57,270
